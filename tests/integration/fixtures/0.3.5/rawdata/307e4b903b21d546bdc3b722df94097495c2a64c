His collection included more than 5,000 books; 3,000 manuscripts; 2,000 etchings and paintings; and several thousand pamphlets.&nbsp;Schomburg served as curator of the Division from 1932 until his death in 1938. In 1940, the Division was renamed the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints in honor of its founder.&nbsp;In 1972, the Schomburg Collection was designated as one of The Research Libraries of The New York Public Library and became the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The expansion of the Schomburg Center in 1991 created spaces for exhibition galleries; the renovated American Negro Theatre; and the 340-seat Langston Hughes Auditorium, in which concerts, forums, lectures, performances, and other special events have taken place.&nbsp;Today, the Schomburg Center contains over 10,000,000 items and provides services and programs for constituents from the United States and abroad.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"title\">The Schomburg Center Today<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 1em; font-size: 13.63636302948px; line-height: 19.0909080505371px;\">The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture is one of the world&#39;s leading research facilities devoted to the preservation of materials on the global African and African diasporan experiences.
