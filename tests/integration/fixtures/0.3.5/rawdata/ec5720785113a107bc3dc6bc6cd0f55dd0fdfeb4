In 2008 his body of work was Inducted to the \"Artist's Archive\" at \"El Museo del Barrio\" in NYC. His paintings have appeared in newspapers and magazines such as the New York Times, Manhattan Arts international, Manhattan Times and The Advocate &amp; Greenwich Times.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>His work centers on the experiences of people within the confines of urban life. Whether in the subway\u2019s, streets, or in a park, Ernesto always strives to capture his subjects in a moment that solely belongs to them; always adding a certain dignity regardless of whether they have much, or little.\u00a0 At times, the observer is given points of reference to understand the situation at hand; but in most cases, it\u2019s left up to his imagination to interpret what is going on; inviting the onlooker to become part of the painting, rather than just a bystander.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ernesto\u2019s lifelong fascination with the trains and people of New York City has inspired him to do an ongoing series entitled, \u201cDiaries of a City\u201d. As a former Ballet Dancer, he has also devoted an ongoing series devoted to dance entitled,\u00a0\u201cMovements of the Heart\u201d.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ernestocamacho.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ernestocamacho.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><span>Bronx 200\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n\t\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bx200.com\/portfolio\/ernesto-camacho\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/bx200.com\/portfolio\/ernesto-camacho\/<\/a><\/p>\n","safe_summary":"\u201cMy passion for Dance began in my late teens when I took my first class in Ballet.
