From the first edition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; to Native American songs to extensive manuscript collections of American composers such as Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Henry Cowell, John Cage, and Louis Moreau Gottschalk, the division has made the documentation of American classical and popular music a major priority. Collection efforts bring to the division a copy of almost every piece of classical and popular music published in the United States each year. Through special arrangements with leading American music publishers, the division also acquires numerous rental scores &ndash; documents that would otherwise be inaccessible for study.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Music Division traces its origins to 1888, when the Lenox Library (which combined with the Astor Library and the Tilden Trust in 1895 to form The New York Public Library) acquired the extraordinary music library of financier Joseph Drexel &ndash; a collection of 6,000 volumes, containing rare 15th- through 19th-century music. Throughout the 20th century the division has built on this core material, at the same time developing a comprehensive collection of basic bibliographies, historical editions, and complete works that supports general research in the field.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vital center for music scholars and students, the Music Division also serves the needs of a broad professional constituency: singers and instrumentalists in search of unusual music, writers preparing program notes for concerts and recordings, lawyers searching copyrights, television producers and book publishers in need of illustrative material, and sociologists studying popular culture. Resources &ndash; available for study free of charge &ndash; include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Printed Books, Scores, and Periodicals<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extensive biographical, historical, and interpretive material is provided through theoretical treatises, contemporary reference works, and subscriptions to over 800 English and foreign-language periodicals. The division houses numerous rare editions of books and scores, as well as modern editions of music from countries throughout the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please note that over 100,000 of our scores do not appear in the online Catalog. &nbsp;Please contact the division for further information.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clippings and Programs<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Articles culled from American and foreign newspapers and arranged under easily accessible personal names and subject headings create clipping files that substantially simplify the process of research. Extensive program files provide details about repertory, performers, and producing organizations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iconography<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visual materials, including over 100,000 photographs, 5,000 set and costume designs for opera, and the Joseph Muller Collection of 6,000 fine prints of musicians&#39; portraits from the 15th through the mid-20th centuries, provide rich documentation for all aspects of music, past and present.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archival Collections<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual and corporate archival collections document all aspects of the art, from the compositional process to the dynamics of the music business. Among the musicians and organizations represented are Marcella Sembrich, Arturo Toscanini, Town Hall, the New Music Society, and Composers Forum.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Autograph Music Manuscripts<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Autograph music manuscripts help illuminate artistic intent and the creative process. The Music Division holds thousands of composers&rsquo; autographs from the 18th through the 20th centuries. This collection is supplemented by the Toscanini Memorial Archives, which contains microfilm copies of autograph music manuscripts housed in libraries throughout the world. Prominently represented in both collections are works of J.S. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Mahler, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner, and Britten.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheet Music<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Close to 500,000 pieces of sheet music, including an extensive collection of American popular songs, demonstrate trends in popular taste as well as the social, political, cultural, and historical issues of the time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electronic Resources<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Library provides access to many music-specific online databases, including&nbsp;<em>Grove Music Online<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>RILM Abstracts of Music Literature<\/em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Index to Printed Music<\/em>. The Library also subscribes to a growing number of electronic journals. Some of these databases and ejournals may be accessed from outside the Library by NYPL cardholders, while others are available onsite only.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Class Visits<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Music Division encourages and welcomes class visits to our facilities. Members of our staff will be happy to meet with you and plan your group visit, customizing the content to suit your particular class needs. Our experienced staff can provide any number of formats&nbsp;ranging&nbsp;from giving introductions to using the the Music Division and Research Library to examining primary sources, discussing and&nbsp;illustrating more complex issues.
