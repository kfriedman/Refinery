The branch is air-conditioned and fully accessible to people who use wheelchairs. A spruce-up project in 2001 provided more PCs for public use, a computer lab in the Center for Reading and Writing, and new carpeting and paint throughout the&nbsp; building.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>CHILDREN&#39;S&nbsp;ROOM<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The Children&#39;s Room now occupies the entire second floor, having been expanded and renovated into a bright and spacious area in early 2010, in a project funded by an anonymous donor. The new layout includes a special area for hosting school visits and toddler activities, and enhanced seating for newborns to children 11 years of age. More desktop and laptop computers are available for children, parents, and caregivers.<br>\r\n\t\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t\tThe collection is large and diverse, ranging from board books for babies, picture books for reading aloud to young children, Easy Books for beginning readers, and strong collections of non-fiction, 5th&ndash;6th grade fiction, and book\/CD kits. The shelving showcases many CDs of children&#39;s music, DVDs of popular films and television shows for children, and magazines to borrow. There is a also&nbsp;basic collection of children&#39;s materials in Spanish.<br>\r\n\t\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t\tWe offer a wide variety of programs for children: Story Hour, Toddler Time, crafts, crocheting, computer classes, and video and board games.

Just for teens, the&nbsp;spacious room is a bright, colorful&nbsp;space with large collections of books, CDs, DVDs, graphic novels, and magazines specifically for this age group.&nbsp; Comfortable casual seating, 6 desktop PCs, and 12 laptop computers attract teens from the several near-by high schools and around Staten Island. The room hosts classes from local schools and community organizations, and presents a full, year-round&nbsp;schedule of programs such as, video gaming, writing workshops, Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments, crafts, science programs, film\/DVD programs, and social and book groups.
