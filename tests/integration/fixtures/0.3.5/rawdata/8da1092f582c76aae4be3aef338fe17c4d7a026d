Faulkner makes of Joe's tragedy a powerful indictment of racism; at the same time Joe's life is a study of the divided self and becomes a symbol of 20th century man. Light in August is the story of Lena Grove's search for the father of her unborn child, and features one of Faulkner's most memorable characters: Joe Christmas, a desperate drifter consumed by his mixed ancestry.","additional_contributors":[],"publishers":[{"name":"Vintage International"}],"pages":512,"series":[],"edition":"1st Vintage international ed","languages":[{"name":"English"}],"contents":[],"performers":[],"suitabilities":[],"notes":["Originally published: Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, 1932","Copyright renewed 1959","Issued also as an Oprah's Book Club 2005 summer selection","\"This revised text and the notes are reprinted from Novels 1930-1935 by William Faulkner, published by the Library of America, 1985, by permission\"--T.p. verso"],"statement_of_responsibility":"William Faulkner","physical_description":["512 p. ; 21 cm."],"primary_language":{"name":"English"},"original_script":{"sub_title":""}}}
