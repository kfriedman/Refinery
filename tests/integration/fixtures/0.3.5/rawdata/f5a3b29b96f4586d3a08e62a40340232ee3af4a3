Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. In the story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sun-drenched Algerian beach, Camus was exploring what he termed \"the nakedness of man faced with the absurd\". Now in a new American translation, the classic has been given new life for generations to come.","additional_contributors":[{"name":"Ward, Matthew"}],"publishers":[{"name":"Vintage International"}],"pages":123,"series":[],"edition":"1st Vintage International ed","languages":[{"name":"English"}],"contents":[],"performers":[],"suitabilities":[],"notes":["Translation of: L'ranger"],"statement_of_responsibility":"Albert Camus ; translated from the French by Matthew Ward","physical_description":["vii, 123 p. ; 21 cm."],"primary_language":{"name":"English"},"original_script":{"sub_title":""}}}
