At the CUNY Graduate Center, Bill has a well-earned reputation as an advocate for scholarly work, an institution builder, and a teacher and mentor. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Given his wealth of experience from these and many additional roles he has undertaken in his career, Bill has much to contribute to The New York Public Library. He arrives to a very full plate of activity, including: recruiting a number of new curators and staff; completing the second story of underground storage underneath Bryant Park so that we can again have as many or more books as ever on site\u2014and now well preserved; working to ensure a great outcome from the Schwarzman Building renovation, which will open up approximately 40 percent more of the building to researchers and the general public; overseeing a $20 million renovation of the Schomburg Center; and much more.

Mostly traced from women and children, each of the hand images was unique, an attempt at capturing the essence of a gesture and the fleeting moment in which it was made. Around the same time, in 1998, I was invited to teach printmaking at <a href=\"http:\/\/art.yale.edu\/Norfolk\">Yale University&rsquo;s Norfolk summer program<\/a>. Like many of the women in the exhibition I worked within the confines of children and family. My then&shy; young children came with me, and we spent time in the nearby woods, making fairy houses out of moss and ferns. I collected and pressed various fern fronds, attracted to their spindly forms and primordial origins.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I soon began assembling the ferns inside the traced hands, securing them with layers of wax, their stems and fronds echoing the body&rsquo;s bones, veins and circulatory systems. Ferns, and then other plants, became both the material and &ldquo;tools&rdquo; for drawing, subverting traditional mark&shy;making methodologies. Later, I introduced printmaking, drawing and photographic techniques, like the Xerox transfer process, to the compositions, in order to further manipulate and &ldquo;distance&rdquo; the imagery. One night, experimenting in Photoshop, I accidentally inverted some of the images: the background darkened into a deep blue and the plant material turned ghostly white. The works suddenly inhabited a space I had been searching for, straddling the indefinable boundary between presence and absence, material and immaterial, consciousness and the unconscious. For me, they became emblematic not only of those whose hands I had traced, but of my own evolving artistic process &ndash; testimony to passing time and the quiet dissolution of memory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"float:right\">[[{\"fid\":\"293290\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Blue Anemone Flower\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Blue Anemone Flower\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Blue Anemone Flower\",\"title\":\"Blue Anemone Flower\",\"height\":\"200\",\"width\":\"200\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]\r\n\t<figcaption>Blue Anemone, Photo by David Wright, 2011<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Simmons first invited me to make prints at her St. Louis studio in 2006.

As the patron saint of children and one of the most revered saints during the Middle Ages, folklore depicts Saint Nicholas as a giver of small gifts to well-behaved children on the eve of his <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Nicholas_Day\">feast day<\/a>, December 6.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrayed as an elderly white-bearded man dressed in red bishop&rsquo;s regalia, complete with staff and miter, Saint Nicholas delivered presents to children throughout Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and parts of Germany as early as the tenth century. This saint, despite his judgmental demeanor, was highly regarded by many 19th century New Yorkers and helped spark the evolution of an American Christmas gift giver.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"float:right\"><img alt=\"St. Nicholas Broadside, distributed to the New-York Historical Society for its first celebration of the Festival of St. Nicholas on December 6th, 1810, New-York Historical Society Library\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22292968%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22St.%20Nicholas%20Broadside,%20distributed%20to%20the%20New-York%20Historical%20Society%20for%20its%20first%20celebration%20of%20the%20Festival%20of%20St.%20Nicholas%20on%20December%206th,%201810,%20New-York%20Historical%20Society%20Library%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22St.%20Nicholas%20Broadside,%20distributed%20to%20the%20New-York%20Historical%20Society%20for%20its%20first%20celebration%20of%20the%20Festival%20of%20St.%20Nicholas%20on%20December%206th,%201810,%20New-York%20Historical%20Society%20Library%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"332\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/St.%20Nicholas%20broadside.png\" title=\"St. Nicholas Broadside, distributed to the New-York Historical Society for its first celebration of the Festival of St. Nicholas on December 6th, 1810, New-York Historical Society Library\" width=\"220\">\r\n\t<figcaption>Broadside of St. Nicholas,&nbsp;distributed to New-York Historical Society members, 1810&nbsp;(New-York Historical Society Library)<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<h2>Saint Nicholas in New York<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the American Revolution, interest in the Dutch colonial history of New York surged, and Saint Nicholas became a favorite anti-British symbol of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyhistory.org\/\">New York Historical Society<\/a> founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Pintard\">John Pintard<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pintard held a strong interest in Saint Nicholas, promoting him as the patron saint of both the Society and the city as a whole throughout the early 1800s.

Written by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clement_Clarke_Moore\">Clement C. Moore<\/a>, a professor at New York&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gts.edu\/\">General Theological Seminary<\/a>, this poem created an unprecedented characterization of Saint Nicholas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizable by its opening line, &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas the night before Christmas,&rdquo; Moore tells a story of a plump &ldquo;jolly old elf&rdquo; who traveled by reindeer-pulled sleigh and descended down chimneys to deliver presents to children&rsquo;s stockings. A friend of Washington Irving, it is speculated that Moore&rsquo;s version of Saint Nicholas was inspired by descriptions in <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/ldpd_11290370_000#page\/n9\/mode\/2up\">Knickerbocker&rsquo;s History of New York<\/a>, and by real-life&nbsp;characteristics of&nbsp;the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wouter_van_Twiller\">first governor of New Netherland<\/a>&nbsp;and a portly Dutch neighbor of Moore&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many details now synonymous with the legend of Santa Claus were first introduced in this poem, including changing Saint Nicholas&rsquo; visit to Christmas Eve instead of the Saint&rsquo;s feast day or New Year&rsquo;s Eve. While there lies some controversy about whether Moore was <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henry_Livingston,_Jr.\">the true author of this poem<\/a>, this depiction left a lasting imprint on American culture, forever changing Christmas lore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"display:inline-block\"><img alt=\"New York American, January 3, 1824\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22292975%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22New%20York%20American,%20January%203,%201824%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22New%20York%20American,%20January%203,%201824%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"237\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/New%20York%20American%201-3-1824.png\" title=\"New York American, January 3, 1824\" width=\"305\">\r\n\t\t<figcaption>New York American, January 3, 1824<\/figcaption>\r\n\t<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"float:right\"><img alt=\"An Ode to Saint Claas, January 4, 1828\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22292973%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22An%20Ode%20to%20Saint%20Claas,%20January%204,%201828%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22An%20Ode%20to%20Saint%20Claas,%20January%204,%201828%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"207\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Ode%20to%20St.%20Claas%20-%20New%20York%20American%20-%201-4-1828.png\" title=\"An Ode to Saint Claas, January 4, 1828\" width=\"250\">\r\n\t<figcaption>New York American, January 4, 1828<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sinterklaas<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Americanized version of Saint Nicholas gained distinction from his European predecessor, so did his name.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Sinterklaas is the Dutch phrase for Saint Nicholas, this word posed some difficulty for American English speakers and prompted an evolution of the gift giver&rsquo;s title.

Money can be heard crinkling throughout the land.&rdquo; If indeed this crinkling was heard in New York during the war years of 1941-1945, was there a documentable trend toward buying American art, since as Mr. Kootz also noted, &ldquo;the future of painting lies in America&rdquo;? Was a &ldquo;buy American&rdquo; movement a reality in the New York art gallery world?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/locations\/divisions\/wallach-division\/art-architecture-collection\">Art &amp; Architecture Collection&rsquo;s<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a> are an excellent resource for this research. The files reveal an active agenda of shows for those who were still patronizing the art market during wartime and there are many examples of galleries showing American art in New York. The Macbeth Gallery, the Babcock Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, and the A.C.A. Gallery are well represented for the World War II years as is the traditional bastion of European art, Knoedler. The Knoedler files have material dating from 1895 and include much material from the 1940s. Knoedler was especially active in charitable events with shows benefiting Belgian Sailors with Allied Fleets (1942), the Red Cross War Relief Fund&mdash;&ldquo;Allied Art for Allied Aid&rdquo; (1942) and, in partnership with Durand-Ruel, a show to benefit British War Relief (1940). Other files also document charitable fundraising, such as a show in 1941 at the Macbeth Gallery to benefit the USO and the Durand Ruel Gallery&rsquo;s 1944 Manet and Picasso show for the benefit of the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society. Peggy Guggenheim&rsquo;s Art of This Century gallery held a surrealist exhibition in October 1942 for the benefit of the Coordinating Council of French Relief Societies, and the Downtown Gallery supported United States War Bonds (&ldquo;You Buy Art, We Buy Bonds&rdquo;).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Knoedler Galleries\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22292885%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Knoedler%20Galleries%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Knoedler%20Galleries:%20%E2%80%9CAllied%20Art%20for%20Allied%20Aid%E2%80%9D%201942%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"474\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Knoedler-Red%20Cross.jpg\" title=\"Knoedler Galleries: \u201cAllied Art for Allied Aid\u201d 1942\" width=\"300\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During World War II the art world in New York was active and changing&mdash;a combination of evolving styles and the influence of European artists escaping the war in Europe and settling in New York. American representational art and American Impressionism&mdash;the staple of the Macbeth and Babcock galleries&mdash;were rapidly giving way to Surrealism and early Abstract Expressionism. Joseph Cornell was very active during these years and produced a number of important box pieces, among them the &ldquo;Medici Slot Machine&rdquo; in 1942, possibly his greatest box. First shown at Julien Levy&rsquo;s Gallery, it was shown in December of 1942 at Art of This Century&mdash;and sold, along with a number of other Cornell boxes. Jackson Pollack was given his first one-man show by Peggy Guggenheim in November of 1943 but sold only one piece&mdash;a drawing to a close friend and business associate of Peggy Guggenheim&rsquo;s, Kenneth Macpherson.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many artists who could get out of Europe did and that wave of emigres included Dali, Ernst, Leger, Breton, Mondrian, and Duchamp. Most made their home, at least for a time, in New York City. Among the galleries who represented them were: Art of This Century, the Julien Levy Gallery, and the Bignou Gallery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following is a selection of galleries well represented in the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a> for the war years:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Bignou Gallery\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22292886%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Bignou%20Gallery%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Bignou%20Gallery:%20British%20War%20Relief%20Society,%201941%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"465\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Bignou%20War%20Relief.jpg\" title=\"Bignou Gallery: British War Relief Society, 1941\" width=\"300\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ACA Gallery<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>(the American Contemporary Art Gallery): A gallery with a long history of political and social activism, ACA was founded in 1932 by Russian born Herman Baron and focused on American art. Stuart Davis was a co-founding artist. &ldquo;Designed to bring the public closer to artists and art events&rdquo; via its art &ldquo;Subscription Program&rdquo; which in 1945-46 offered original lithographs or silkscreen prints from a group by Tromka, Evergood, M. Soyer, R. Soyer, Lozowick, Kopman, Jules, Sternberg, Olds and Gottlieb; a subscription to American Contemporary Art magazine, all ACA publications (catalogues, monographs, etc.), admission to lectures, and events for children - all for $10 a year. Many of the artists represented by ACA were involved in a union organization for themselves and others. Much of their work featured gritty representations of cities and working people as had been represented in the earlier exhibitions of American artists at the Macbeth Gallery&mdash;a kind of next generation Ashcan School. Among the artists exhibiting during the war years were Moses Soyer, Philip Evergood, William Gropper, David Burliuk, Ben Shan, and Raphael Soyer. In May 1945, the A.C.A. Gallery published a 78 pg. illustrated pamphlet entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b14132968~S1\">Why I Hate the Nazis<\/a>&rdquo; by Corporal Milton J. Wynne (available in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/locations\/divisions\/wallach-division\/art-architecture-collection\">Art &amp; Architecture Collection<\/a>). August 1945 brought the National Maritime Union Exhibition of Merchant Seamen&rsquo;s Water Colors and Drawings (A project of the NMU Educational Department in Cooperation with the United Seamen&rsquo;s Service) featuring the art of non-professionals. In spite of this, by 1949 the A.C.A. gallery would be labeled as &ldquo;a spearhead of radical influence which is debasing art standards through Communist infiltration&rdquo; by Republican congressman George A. Dondero of Michigan. This is documented by news clippings of the time in the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a>. It is notable that A.C.A. artist Reginald Marsh&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Bowery&rdquo; was in the collection of Democratic Senator (and publisher of the Encyclopedia Britannica) William A. Benton of Connecticut&mdash;an ardent foe of Sen. Joseph McCarthy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional materials are available through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aaa.si.edu\/collections\/aca-galleries-records-8772\">Archives of American Art<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/libmma.org\/portal\/\">Watson Library<\/a> of the Metropolitan Museum of Art also has a number of A.C.A.

This undertaking will serve its purpose only if it succeeds in serving the future instead of recording the past&rdquo;. A typical roster is represented in this April 1944 show: Bracque, Dali, Ernst, Hare, Helion, Hirshfeld, Leger, Kandinsky, Masson, Matta, Miro, Mondrian, Motherwell, Pereira, Picasso, Rothko, Tanguy, Vail, and Waldberg.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional material available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guggenheim.org\/new-york\/collections\/library-and-archives\/archive-collections\/M0002\/\">The Peggy Guggenheim Foundation papers<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Babcock Gallery<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now known as the Driscoll Babcock Gallery, it was the oldest gallery devoted exclusively to American Art. The Babcock Gallery was founded by John Snedecor in 1852 and originally called the Snedecor Gallery. It was renamed the Babcock Gallery in 1918. Like the Macbeth Gallery, the Babcock under the direction of Carmine Dalesio exhibited many of the best names in American art, such as: Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, Arthur B. Davies, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Albert P. Ryder, and George Bellows. The Babcock Gallery was active during the war years and the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a> contain numerous announcements for exhibits between 1940&mdash;1945.

The Macbeth Gallery, the Babcock Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, and the A.C.A. Gallery are well represented for the World War II years as is the traditional bastion of European art, Knoedler. The Knoedler files have material dating from 1895 and include much material from the 1940s. Knoedler was especially active in charitable events with shows benefiting Belgian Sailors with Allied Fleets (1942), the Red Cross War Relief Fund\u2014\u201cAllied Art for Allied Aid\u201d (1942) and, in partnership with Durand-Ruel, a show to benefit British War Relief (1940).

Peggy Guggenheim\u2019s Art of This Century gallery held a surrealist exhibition in October 1942 for the benefit of the Coordinating Council of French Relief Societies, and the Downtown Gallery supported United States War Bonds (\u201cYou Buy Art, We Buy Bonds\u201d).<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Knoedler Galleries\" class=\"media-element file-default\" height=\"474\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Knoedler-Red%20Cross.jpg\" title=\" \u201cAllied Art for Allied Aid\u201d 1942\" width=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>During World War II the art world in New York was active and changing\u2014a combination of evolving styles and the influence of European artists escaping the war in Europe and settling in New York. American representational art and American Impressionism\u2014the staple of the Macbeth and Babcock galleries\u2014were rapidly giving way to Surrealism and early Abstract Expressionism. Joseph Cornell was very active during these years and produced a number of important box pieces, among them the \u201cMedici Slot Machine\u201d in 1942, possibly his greatest box. First shown at Julien Levy\u2019s Gallery, it was shown in December of 1942 at Art of This Century\u2014and sold, along with a number of other Cornell boxes. Jackson Pollack was given his first one-man show by Peggy Guggenheim in November of 1943 but sold only one piece\u2014a drawing to a close friend and business associate of Peggy Guggenheim\u2019s, Kenneth Macpherson.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many artists who could get out of Europe did and that wave of emigres included Dali, Ernst, Leger, Breton, Mondrian, and Duchamp. Most made their home, at least for a time, in New York City. Among the galleries who represented them were: Art of This Century, the Julien Levy Gallery, and the Bignou Gallery.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following is a selection of galleries well represented in the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a> for the war years:<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Bignou Gallery\" class=\"media-element file-default\" height=\"465\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Bignou%20War%20Relief.jpg\" title=\" British War Relief Society, 1941\" width=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>ACA Gallery<\/h3>\n\n<p>(the American Contemporary Art Gallery): A gallery with a long history of political and social activism, ACA was founded in 1932 by Russian born Herman Baron and focused on American art. Stuart Davis was a co-founding artist. \u201cDesigned to bring the public closer to artists and art events\u201d via its art \u201cSubscription Program\u201d which in 1945-46 offered original lithographs or silkscreen prints from a group by Tromka, Evergood, M. Soyer, R. Soyer, Lozowick, Kopman, Jules, Sternberg, Olds and Gottlieb; a subscription to American Contemporary Art magazine, all ACA publications (catalogues, monographs, etc.), admission to lectures, and events for children - all for $10 a year. Many of the artists represented by ACA were involved in a union organization for themselves and others. Much of their work featured gritty representations of cities and working people as had been represented in the earlier exhibitions of American artists at the Macbeth Gallery\u2014a kind of next generation Ashcan School. Among the artists exhibiting during the war years were Moses Soyer, Philip Evergood, William Gropper, David Burliuk, Ben Shan, and Raphael Soyer. In May 1945, the A.C.A. Gallery published a 78 pg. illustrated pamphlet entitled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b14132968~S1\">Why I Hate the Nazis<\/a>\u201d by Corporal Milton J. Wynne (available in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/locations\/divisions\/wallach-division\/art-architecture-collection\">Art &amp; Architecture Collection<\/a>). August 1945 brought the National Maritime Union Exhibition of Merchant Seamen\u2019s Water Colors and Drawings (A project of the NMU Educational Department in Cooperation with the United Seamen\u2019s Service) featuring the art of non-professionals. In spite of this, by 1949 the A.C.A. gallery would be labeled as \u201ca spearhead of radical influence which is debasing art standards through Communist infiltration\u201d by Republican congressman George A. Dondero of Michigan. This is documented by news clippings of the time in the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a>. It is notable that A.C.A. artist Reginald Marsh\u2019s \u201cThe Bowery\u201d was in the collection of Democratic Senator (and publisher of the Encyclopedia Britannica) William A. Benton of Connecticut\u2014an ardent foe of Sen.

The press release for the opening of the gallery in 1942 is in the file and includes this statement from Peggy Guggenheim: \u201cOpening this Gallery and its collection to the public during a time when people are fighting for their lives and freedom is a responsibility of which I am fully conscious. This undertaking will serve its purpose only if it succeeds in serving the future instead of recording the past\u201d. A typical roster is represented in this April 1944 show: Bracque, Dali, Ernst, Hare, Helion, Hirshfeld, Leger, Kandinsky, Masson, Matta, Miro, Mondrian, Motherwell, Pereira, Picasso, Rothko, Tanguy, Vail, and Waldberg.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additional material available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guggenheim.org\/new-york\/collections\/library-and-archives\/archive-collections\/M0002\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Peggy Guggenheim Foundation papers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Babcock Gallery<\/h3>\n\n<p>Now known as the Driscoll Babcock Gallery, it was the oldest gallery devoted exclusively to American Art. The Babcock Gallery was founded by John Snedecor in 1852 and originally called the Snedecor Gallery. It was renamed the Babcock Gallery in 1918. Like the Macbeth Gallery, the Babcock under the direction of Carmine Dalesio exhibited many of the best names in American art, such as: Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, Arthur B. Davies, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Albert P. Ryder, and George Bellows. The Babcock Gallery was active during the war years and the <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Pamphlet%20Files%20March2015.pdf\">Pamphlet Files<\/a> contain numerous announcements for exhibits between 1940\u20141945.
