Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs unites what had formerly been three separate departments under a single banner. Divisional holdings comprise works of art as well as reference materials on painting, sculpture, drawing, printmaking, photography and the history of architecture from prehistoric times to the present. The Wallach Division also serves as the access point to the Spencer Collection of fine bindings and illustrated books. Together, these collections include more than one million works of art in various mediums and formats, complemented by nearly 700,000 monographs and periodicals. The quality, depth and scope of these holdings have earned the Wallach Division an international reputation among a broad variety of scholars and lovers of art.","access":"Fully Accessible","accessibility_note":"","contacts":{"phone":"(212) 930-0835"},"cross_street":"","floor":null,"fundraising":{"id":275290,"statement":"Friends of the Library can support their favorite library and receive great benefits!","appeal":"Become a Member","button_label":"Join or Renew","link":"https:\/\/secure3.convio.net\/nypl\/site\/SPageServer?pagename=donation_friend_form&s_src=FRQ16ZZ_FRCA"},"geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9822,40.7532]},"hours":{"regular":[{"day":"Sun.","open":"13:00","close":"17:00"},{"day":"Mon.","open":"10:00","close":"18:00"},{"day":"Tue.","open":"10:00","close":"20:00"},{"day":"Wed.","open":"10:00","close":"20:00"},{"day":"Thu.","open":"10:00","close":"18:00"},{"day":"Fri.","open":"10:00","close":"18:00"},{"day":"Sat.","open":"10:00","close":"18:00"}]},"id":"WAL","images":{"interior":"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/locations\/8002\/research_interior_2014_09_18_sasb_combo_300_308_0.jpg","collection_item":"http:\/\/cdn-prod.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/locations\/8002\/dc_sasb_wallach_0.jpg"},"locality":"New York","location_id":"SASB","name":"The Miriam and Ira D.
