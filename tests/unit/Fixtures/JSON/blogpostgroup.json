So far I&#39;ve taken on Silly Putty, Salt Crystals,&nbsp;and Lemon Batteries (more on those later).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually I start with the&nbsp;<strong>lesson portion,<\/strong>&nbsp;as&nbsp;it gets more and more difficult to keep the group attentive and focused&nbsp;once they have something in their hands to &#39;experiment&#39; with.&nbsp; This lesson starts off with some&nbsp;<strong>useful vocab<\/strong>, and then a breakdown of the&nbsp;<strong>scientific concepts<\/strong>&nbsp;that are important to our experiment and how those concepts can relate to their daily lives. &nbsp;I usually have a rough lesson plan written up, and then I cater the lesson to the group of kids depending on age, interest, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For example,&nbsp;when making Silly Putty, I defined Chemical Property, Physical Property, Mixture, and Compound. Then we talked about the different properties of the materials we were working with (glue, water, borax soap) and how we thought they might change.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we&nbsp;<strong>perform the experiment<\/strong>&nbsp;together. I try to let everyone have something that&#39;s &#39;theirs&#39;, and have a sample up front they can follow along with. If there&#39;s anything too messy or complicated I do some preliminary steps, but it&rsquo;s important to them that they do the final touches. We talk through each step and what&rsquo;s happening and how we should NOT eat what we&rsquo;re making, and so on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To finish off the experiment we usually&nbsp;<strong>recap what just happened<\/strong>&nbsp;scientifically and how it related to what we learned earlier. Then I let the kids ask questions. To get them more interested (and also to give our non-fiction section a little more love), I usually&nbsp;<strong>pull books on the subject<\/strong>&nbsp;we&#39;re studying and have them displayed at the front of the room for borrowing. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Results\/Conclusion:<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet to be determined! I&#39;m still working out the kinks on so many levels, and having a lot of fun doing so. So far I&#39;ve gotten up to 12 kids per program, and already have pre-k and kindergarten classes asking about how they can participate.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This blog will hopefully serve as a&nbsp;platform for anyone who&#39;s interested in similar programming and a place to exchange ideas. I&#39;ll be here to chronicle what worked for me, and what could be improved.&nbsp;So please, let me know in the comments anything that&#39;s worked for you, what you want to see, and stop by Chatham Square to get in on this new project!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Next up:<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Volcanoes!<\/strong>&nbsp;Another old standby that was actually requested by one of my regular participants in this program. Each child is going to make their own clay volcano and make it &#39;explode&#39;, as it were, with baking soda and vinegar. &nbsp;But instead of doing a lesson on chemical reactions, which they&#39;ve already gotten with the silly putty, I&#39;m making this an&nbsp;<strong>earth-science focused lesson<\/strong>, maybe even throwing in a little knowledge about tectonic plate movements.

So far I've taken on Silly Putty, Salt Crystals,\u00a0and Lemon Batteries (more on those later).\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually I start with the\u00a0<strong>lesson portion,<\/strong>\u00a0as\u00a0it gets more and more difficult to keep the group attentive and focused\u00a0once they have something in their hands to 'experiment' with.\u00a0 This lesson starts off with some\u00a0<strong>useful vocab<\/strong>, and then a breakdown of the\u00a0<strong>scientific concepts<\/strong>\u00a0that are important to our experiment and how those concepts can relate to their daily lives. \u00a0I usually have a rough lesson plan written up, and then I cater the lesson to the group of kids depending on age, interest, etc.<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>For example,\u00a0when making Silly Putty, I defined Chemical Property, Physical Property, Mixture, and Compound. Then we talked about the different properties of the materials we were working with (glue, water, borax soap) and how we thought they might change.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Then we\u00a0<strong>perform the experiment<\/strong>\u00a0together. I try to let everyone have something that's 'theirs', and have a sample up front they can follow along with. If there's anything too messy or complicated I do some preliminary steps, but it\u2019s important to them that they do the final touches. We talk through each step and what\u2019s happening and how we should NOT eat what we\u2019re making, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>To finish off the experiment we usually\u00a0<strong>recap what just happened<\/strong>\u00a0scientifically and how it related to what we learned earlier. Then I let the kids ask questions. To get them more interested (and also to give our non-fiction section a little more love), I usually\u00a0<strong>pull books on the subject<\/strong>\u00a0we're studying and have them displayed at the front of the room for borrowing. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Results\/Conclusion:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Yet to be determined! I'm still working out the kinks on so many levels, and having a lot of fun doing so. So far I've gotten up to 12 kids per program, and already have pre-k and kindergarten classes asking about how they can participate.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>This blog will hopefully serve as a\u00a0platform for anyone who's interested in similar programming and a place to exchange ideas. I'll be here to chronicle what worked for me, and what could be improved.\u00a0So please, let me know in the comments anything that's worked for you, what you want to see, and stop by Chatham Square to get in on this new project!<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Next up:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Volcanoes!<\/strong>\u00a0Another old standby that was actually requested by one of my regular participants in this program. Each child is going to make their own clay volcano and make it 'explode', as it were, with baking soda and vinegar. \u00a0But instead of doing a lesson on chemical reactions, which they've already gotten with the silly putty, I'm making this an\u00a0<strong>earth-science focused lesson<\/strong>, maybe even throwing in a little knowledge about tectonic plate movements. It\u2019s set for <strong>TODAY at 3:30 <\/strong>and I'll be back to report how it goes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Some resources:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for some inspiration

Once a household name among New York Yiddish speakers, he even appeared in ads for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fundinguniverse.com\/company-histories\/beech-nut-nutrition-corporation-history\/\">Beech-Nut Gum<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seagram\">S<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seagram\">eagram&rsquo;s Whiskey<\/a>, and Planter&rsquo;s High Hat Peanut Oil.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before his radio days, Stutchkoff worked as a translator, actor, playwright and lyricist. He began by translating plays from various European languages into Yiddish, and later wrote his own. More than 20 of his (unpublished) plays were performed in America, including titles like &ldquo;Oy, Amerike!&rdquo; (Oy, America!), &ldquo;Di ganevte&rdquo; (The Lady Thief) and &ldquo;Ven Blinde Libn&rdquo; (When Blind People Love). Many of these playscripts survive in his extensive archives in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/locations\/divisions\/jewish-division\">Dorot Jewish Division<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/\">New York Public Library<\/a>, and in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/rr\/amed\/marwick\/marwickbibliography.pdf\">Library of Congress<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Stutchkoff&rsquo;s lyrics were published in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcat.org\/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=stutchkoff+nahum#x0%253Amsscr-format\">sheet music<\/a> composed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.milkenarchive.org\/people\/view\/all\/499\/Sholom+Secunda\">Sholom Secunda<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.milkenarchive.org\/people\/view\/all\/506\/Joseph+Rumshinsky\">Joseph Rumshinsky<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.milkenarchive.org\/people\/view\/all\/511\/Abraham+Ellstein\">Abe Ellstein<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/search~S1\/?searchtype=a&amp;searcharg=%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99+%D7%A4&amp;searchscope=1&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=a%7Bu05DC%7D%7Bu05D0%7D%7Bu05E1%7D%7Bu05E7%7D%7Bu05D0%7D%7Bu05D5%7D%7Bu05D5%7D%7Bu05E1%7D%7Bu05E7%7D%7Bu05D9%7D+%7Bu05E4%7D\">Phillip Laskowsky<\/a>.

A far cry from today&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yivo.org\/about\/index.php?tid=57&amp;aid=275\">standard Yiddish<\/a>, the transliterations were, like many of their day, frequently riddled with typos and inconsistencies.

The database is easy to use, it is updated on a daily basis, and it contains a multitude of articles about many different topics. Oftentimes, when patrons are unable to find information in a print book about a subject, they can find it in this database. It contains information about esoteric and unusual topics that do not have entire books written about them.

It is not only the way that Pratchett uses the Discworld universe to discuss real world issues like prejudice (<em><a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20505998052907\" title=\"Equal Rites\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equal Rites<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/18081254052907\" title=\"Monstrous Regiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monstrous Regiment<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/19075843052907\" title=\"Snuff\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snuff<\/a><\/em>), the influence of new technology (<em><a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/19708147052907\" title=\"The Truth\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Truth<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/17723967052907\" title=\"Moving Pictures\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moving Pictures<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20010403052907\" title=\"Raising Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raising Steam<\/a>)<\/em> or religious belief (<em><a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20260750052907\" title=\"Small Gods\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Gods<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20505589052907\" title=\"Pyramids\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pyramids<\/a>, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/17814431052907\" title=\"The Fifth Elephant\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Fifth Elephant<\/a><\/em>) but the honesty and thought he conveys when talking about life itself. Pratchett\u2019s book may take place in a world of magic, but life is still just as difficult and unfair. I know that doesn\u2019t sound like a bunch of laughs but truth is the essential burning core of any good joke and truth is often unpleasant. This is how I know Terry Pratchett is a master humorist. He can take the solemn, the serious, the truth and make me chuckle about it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are just a few gems:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\"The presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those who think they've found it.\" \u2014from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/18081254052907\" title=\"Monstrous Regiment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monstrous Regiment<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\t<p>\"The problem with an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put\u00a0things in it\" \u2014from <em><a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/19670415052907\" title=\"Diggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diggers<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\t<p>\"Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.

Unfortunately, the year 1968 will forever go down in world&nbsp;history&nbsp;as a year full of unrest and turmoil.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a lighter note, the year 1968 is also known amongst baseball circles as &quot;The Year of the Pitcher.&quot; See, after <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Roger Maris\">Roger Maris<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Mickey Mantle\">Mickey Mantle<\/a> treated America to a summer of excitement in 1961&nbsp;with their chase for <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Babe Ruth\">Babe Ruth<\/a>&#39;s single&nbsp;season home run record (which Maris would eventually claim with 61 long balls), Major League Baseball decided something had to be done to tame this kind of offensive productivity. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ended up widening the strike zone, and though this did have the effect on the sport that he aimed for, all in all the ramifications of the move were harmful to the sport. Offense went way down for a number of years, and attendance ended up shrinking thanks to that as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This all came to a head in 1968, where the numbers pitchers posted were so off-the-charts ridiculous, the League had to do away with the changes it made to the strike zone the following season. In addition to shrinking the strike zone, the pitchers mound was also lowered from 15 inches down to 10 inches. Baseball has thus never again seen such a statistical disparity between pitching and hitting since that year. It was a year like no other, for reasons both good and bad. But let&#39;s stick with the good, and highlight some of the incredible feats that were accomplished in baseball during the 1968 campaign.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Bob Gibson&#39;s 1968 Season -&nbsp;<\/strong>If we had to designate a poster child for the Year of the Pitcher, it would be have to be the Cardinals pitcher nicknamed &quot;Hoot,&quot; <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?q=Gibson%2C+Bob%2C+1935-&amp;search_category=author&amp;t=author\">Bob Gibson<\/a>. He was at his best all season long, and in a career full of accolades and achievements, Gibson&#39;s 1968 season may be his magnum opus. The numbers simply speak for themselves. Gibson finished second in the National League&nbsp;wins with 22&nbsp;(Juan Marichal led the Senior Circuit with 26), but&nbsp;led the league in shutouts, WHIP, hits per nine innings, and strikeouts. However none of those numbers have become as heralded as the 1.12 ERA Gibson posted that season, which set the live-ball era record, and is the fourth&nbsp;lowest of all-time. He also had a 47 and two-thirds scoreless inning streak that season. Gibson&#39;s utter dominance during the regular season netted him not only the National League Cy Young, but the NL MVP Award as well. Gibson&#39;s powerful pitching continued on in the World Series, where his St. Louis squad took on the Detroit Tigers. In Game 1, Gibson tossed a complete game shutout, with 17 strikeouts, another record that still stands today. Game 4 was another complete game victory for Gibson, and everyone figured the Cardinals had the Series in the bag when Hoot toed the rubber for the deciding Game 7. However, despite tossing his third complete game of that World Series, a famous misplay by centerfielder Curt Flood helped bring about the Cardinals&#39; downfall in that game, and the Tigers wound up winning it all. Regardless, Gibson put on an absolute clinic all year long whenever he took the 15 inch-high mound, &nbsp;and his 1968 season is one we&#39;ll probably never see replicated ever again.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Denny McLain&#39;s 1968 Season -&nbsp;<\/strong>While <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?q=McLain%2C+Denny&amp;search_category=author&amp;t=author\">Denny <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?q=McLain%2C+Denny&amp;search_category=author&amp;t=author\">McLain<\/a>&#39;s (then of the Detroit Tigers)&nbsp;1968 season wasn&#39;t quite on par with the sheer dominance Bob Gibson had, his year is not to be forgotten either. McLain&#39;s 1968 is best remembered for his Major league-leading 31 victories. He was the first pitcher since Dizzy Dean in 1934 to eclipse the 30-win marker, and is the last pitcher to achieve the feat. In addition to his 31 wins, McLain also led of all of baseball in innings pitched (336) and starts (41). McLain&nbsp;was always prone to the long ball all throughout his career, and&nbsp;ended up leading baseball&nbsp;in home runs allowed too, serving up 31. Nonetheless, McLain&#39;s regular season was still something to behold (he was 16-2 at the All Star break!)&nbsp;and he ended up taking home both the American League Cy Young and MVP awards, just like his National League counterpart Gibson did. This marked the only season ever where a pitcher won the MVP award in both leagues. McLain&#39;s World Series performance however left a lot to be desired, and it was up to a teammate of his to bail the Tigers out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Mickey Lolich&#39;s World Series - <\/strong>Detroit Tiger&nbsp;Mickey Lolich had a nice season in 1968. He went 17-9 and with a respectable 3.19 ERA. However, pitching &nbsp;in the same rotation as Denny McLain, it&#39;s easy to get overshadowed. McLain would anchor the 1968 Tigers staff, winning Cy Young and MVP hardware along the way, while Lolich would be a complementary piece of the Detroit rotation. This goes without mentioning how contrasting the personalities of the two men were. McLain was the type of guy who would command the limelight and the attention no matter where he went. Lolich on the other hand was easily lost in the crowd with his quiet demeanor.&nbsp;However, Lolich made sure his name was not&nbsp;to be forgotten once the &#39;68 World Series ended, a Fall Classic which etched his name into the history books. Down 1 game to none, Lolich tossed a complete game victory in Game 2. Down 3 games to 1, Lolich tossed another complete game victory. Then arrived Game 7. On 2 days rest, Detroit manager Mayo Smith handed the ball to Lolich for the Series finale, and he did not disappoint. Lolich matched zeroes with Cards starter Bob Gibson through 6 frames before the Tigers finally were able to break through in the 7th, taking a lead they would never relinquish en route to the title. Lolich became the 12th pitcher to win 3 games in a single World Series, (Randy Johnson made 13 in 2001), and his heroics ended up earning him the World Series MVP award.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Catfish Hunter&#39;s Perfect Game -&nbsp;<\/strong>Prior to May 8, 1968, you had to go back to Game 5 of the 1956 World Series to find the last perfect game pitched in the American League, that one authored by Don Larsen. As for the regular season, you&#39;d have to go back even further to 1922 when Charlie Roberston of the White Sox sat down 27 consecutive batters one afternoon against the Tigers. The National League had a pair of perfectos in that span by Jim Bunning and Sandy Koufax, but the AL went without. That all changed one Wednesday evening in 1968. <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Jim+%22Catfish%22+Hunter&amp;searchOpt=catalogue\">Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Hunter<\/a> of the Oakland Athletics opposed Dave Boswell of the Minnesota Twins, and the end result was all Hunter. Catfish&nbsp;had himself quite the day not only on the mound but with the bat as well, driving in 3 of the 4 Athletic runs en route to his 4-0 perfect game. With this perfecto, the 9th in baseball history, Hunter also became&mdash;and remains&mdash;the youngest pitcher to toss a modern-era perfect game at 22 years and 30 days old.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Don Drysdale&#39;s Scoreless Innings Streak - <\/strong>Though this has since been broken by another (Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers during the 1988 campaign), that should not take away from what <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Don+Drysdale&amp;searchOpt=catalogue\">Don Drysdale<\/a> accomplished during the Year of the Pitcher. He threw up 58 and 2\/3 consecutive innings without allowing a run, a stretch that included six straight shutouts, a record that does still stand today. The streak lasted from May 14 to June 8 of &#39;68. There were some quirky side stories that came about as the streak was alive. One, the man who snapped the streak with a sacrifice fly, a Philadelphia Phillie outfielder named Howie Bedell, had only 3 runs batted in his career. Now you all know which ribby is the one that everyone ought to know. Another interesting moment happened during the fifth start of the scoreless innings streak. Drysdale was facing the San Francisco Giants, and in a bases loaded situation, Giants catcher Dick Dietz strode to the plate. Dietz ends up getting hit by a pitch, which should have forced in a run breaking the streak right? Wrong! Umpire Harry Wendelstadt made the <em>gutsiest <\/em>of calls, and declared Dietz made no effort to get out of the way of Drysdale&#39;s pitch, and thus the at-bat would continue. Drysdale wound up escaping the jam with the streak still alive. Drysdale may have done all of the heavy lifting, but Wendelstadt at least deserves an assist during the remarkable scoreless sequence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read more about the Year of the Pitcher and its great hurlers, like &quot;Sudden&quot; Sam McDowell, Luis Tiant, and Dave McNally, <a class=\"catalog-link\" data-id=\"19540810052907_summer_of_68\" data-keywords=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/19540810052907_summer_of_68\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"check out Tim Wendel's book!\">check out Tim Wendel&#39;s book!<\/a><\/p>\r\n","summary":"1968 was a year of misfortune.

He also had a 47 and two-thirds scoreless inning streak that season. Gibson's utter dominance during the regular season netted him not only the National League Cy Young, but the NL MVP Award as well. Gibson's powerful pitching continued on in the World Series, where his St. Louis squad took on the Detroit Tigers. In Game 1, Gibson tossed a complete game shutout, with 17 strikeouts, another record that still stands today. Game 4 was another complete game victory for Gibson, and everyone figured the Cardinals had the Series in the bag when Hoot toed the rubber for the deciding Game 7. However, despite tossing his third complete game of that World Series, a famous misplay by centerfielder Curt Flood helped bring about the Cardinals' downfall in that game, and the Tigers wound up winning it all. Regardless, Gibson put on an absolute clinic all year long whenever he took the 15 inch-high mound, \u00a0and his 1968 season is one we'll probably never see replicated ever again.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Denny McLain's 1968 Season -\u00a0<\/strong>While <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?q=McLain%2C+Denny&amp;search_category=author&amp;t=author\" rel=\"nofollow\">Denny <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?q=McLain%2C+Denny&amp;search_category=author&amp;t=author\" rel=\"nofollow\">McLain<\/a>'s (then of the Detroit Tigers)\u00a01968 season wasn't quite on par with the sheer dominance Bob Gibson had, his year is not to be forgotten either. McLain's 1968 is best remembered for his Major league-leading 31 victories. He was the first pitcher since Dizzy Dean in 1934 to eclipse the 30-win marker, and is the last pitcher to achieve the feat. In addition to his 31 wins, McLain also led of all of baseball in innings pitched (336) and starts (41). McLain\u00a0was always prone to the long ball all throughout his career, and\u00a0ended up leading baseball\u00a0in home runs allowed too, serving up 31. Nonetheless, McLain's regular season was still something to behold (he was 16-2 at the All Star break!)\u00a0and he ended up taking home both the American League Cy Young and MVP awards, just like his National League counterpart Gibson did. This marked the only season ever where a pitcher won the MVP award in both leagues. McLain's World Series performance however left a lot to be desired, and it was up to a teammate of his to bail the Tigers out.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Mickey Lolich's World Series - <\/strong>Detroit Tiger\u00a0Mickey Lolich had a nice season in 1968. He went 17-9 and with a respectable 3.19 ERA. However, pitching \u00a0in the same rotation as Denny McLain, it's easy to get overshadowed. McLain would anchor the 1968 Tigers staff, winning Cy Young and MVP hardware along the way, while Lolich would be a complementary piece of the Detroit rotation. This goes without mentioning how contrasting the personalities of the two men were. McLain was the type of guy who would command the limelight and the attention no matter where he went. Lolich on the other hand was easily lost in the crowd with his quiet demeanor.\u00a0However, Lolich made sure his name was not\u00a0to be forgotten once the '68 World Series ended, a Fall Classic which etched his name into the history books. Down 1 game to none, Lolich tossed a complete game victory in Game 2. Down 3 games to 1, Lolich tossed another complete game victory. Then arrived Game 7. On 2 days rest, Detroit manager Mayo Smith handed the ball to Lolich for the Series finale, and he did not disappoint. Lolich matched zeroes with Cards starter Bob Gibson through 6 frames before the Tigers finally were able to break through in the 7th, taking a lead they would never relinquish en route to the title. Lolich became the 12th pitcher to win 3 games in a single World Series, (Randy Johnson made 13 in 2001), and his heroics ended up earning him the World Series MVP award.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Catfish Hunter's Perfect Game -\u00a0<\/strong>Prior to May 8, 1968, you had to go back to Game 5 of the 1956 World Series to find the last perfect game pitched in the American League, that one authored by Don Larsen. As for the regular season, you'd have to go back even further to 1922 when Charlie Roberston of the White Sox sat down 27 consecutive batters one afternoon against the Tigers. The National League had a pair of perfectos in that span by Jim Bunning and Sandy Koufax, but the AL went without. That all changed one Wednesday evening in 1968. <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Jim+%22Catfish%22+Hunter&amp;searchOpt=catalogue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim \"Catfish\" Hunter<\/a> of the Oakland Athletics opposed Dave Boswell of the Minnesota Twins, and the end result was all Hunter. Catfish\u00a0had himself quite the day not only on the mound but with the bat as well, driving in 3 of the 4 Athletic runs en route to his 4-0 perfect game. With this perfecto, the 9th in baseball history, Hunter also became\u2014and remains\u2014the youngest pitcher to toss a modern-era perfect game at 22 years and 30 days old.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Don Drysdale's Scoreless Innings Streak - <\/strong>Though this has since been broken by another (Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers during the 1988 campaign), that should not take away from what <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Don+Drysdale&amp;searchOpt=catalogue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don Drysdale<\/a> accomplished during the Year of the Pitcher. He threw up 58 and 2\/3 consecutive innings without allowing a run, a stretch that included six straight shutouts, a record that does still stand today. The streak lasted from May 14 to June 8 of '68. There were some quirky side stories that came about as the streak was alive. One, the man who snapped the streak with a sacrifice fly, a Philadelphia Phillie outfielder named Howie Bedell, had only 3 runs batted in his career. Now you all know which ribby is the one that everyone ought to know. Another interesting moment happened during the fifth start of the scoreless innings streak. Drysdale was facing the San Francisco Giants, and in a bases loaded situation, Giants catcher Dick Dietz strode to the plate. Dietz ends up getting hit by a pitch, which should have forced in a run breaking the streak right? Wrong! Umpire Harry Wendelstadt made the <em>gutsiest <\/em>of calls, and declared Dietz made no effort to get out of the way of Drysdale's pitch, and thus the at-bat would continue. Drysdale wound up escaping the jam with the streak still alive. Drysdale may have done all of the heavy lifting, but Wendelstadt at least deserves an assist during the remarkable scoreless sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>To read more about the Year of the Pitcher and its great hurlers, like \"Sudden\" Sam McDowell, Luis Tiant, and Dave McNally, <a class=\"catalog-link\" href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/19540810052907_summer_of_68\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"check out Tim Wendel&#039;s book!\" rel=\"nofollow\">check out Tim Wendel's book!<\/a><\/p>\n","safe_summary":"1968 was a year of misfortune.

Not always to check out books, I would come to the Rose Reading Room to dream, and what I never would have expected is that I was dreaming about a book that would seem to be to do with the very opposite of what often dreams are about&mdash;adversity, failure, and the gift of those things.&nbsp;As I worked in the arts, I really wanted to write about what I saw happening in artists&rsquo; studios that wasn&rsquo;t public oftentimes. These back-turned paintings that artists weren&rsquo;t going to burn or kind of throw out, but were important for what they did want to show me. So the book is really looking at&mdash;as an atlas of the stories of the lives of so many different entrepreneurs and inventors and artists and athletes, to understand what it is that led to their rise.&quot;<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This atlas of stories includes some about the role of surrender in the grieving process. Lewis&nbsp;recalled the way that she has personally dealt with loss:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>&quot;Over the course of a year and a half, I lost friends in quick succession. This was when I was in my young twenties after college and due to 9\/11, but others were accidents and I hadn&rsquo;t fully let myself process it...&nbsp;And I wrote about surrender in this chapter as it relates to grief and this need to finally let go of what&rsquo;s sort of holding you and in that moment for me at least that release that came when I saw that I was still here, you know, and that I wanted to live my life in a way that really showed that consciousness and appreciation that I was still here and I in that moment felt that I would need to be free enough to do things and possibly fail in order to become my fullest self, you know. &quot;<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In some ways, the self, as Lewis&nbsp;imagines it, is developed and tested through a quest.

Not always to check out books, I would come to the Rose Reading Room to dream, and what I never would have expected is that I was dreaming about a book that would seem to be to do with the very opposite of what often dreams are about\u2014adversity, failure, and the gift of those things.\u00a0As I worked in the arts, I really wanted to write about what I saw happening in artists\u2019 studios that wasn\u2019t public oftentimes. These back-turned paintings that artists weren\u2019t going to burn or kind of throw out, but were important for what they did want to show me. So the book is really looking at\u2014as an atlas of the stories of the lives of so many different entrepreneurs and inventors and artists and athletes, to understand what it is that led to their rise.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>This atlas of stories includes some about the role of surrender in the grieving process. Lewis\u00a0recalled the way that she has personally dealt with loss:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\"Over the course of a year and a half, I lost friends in quick succession. This was when I was in my young twenties after college and due to 9\/11, but others were accidents and I hadn\u2019t fully let myself process it...\u00a0And I wrote about surrender in this chapter as it relates to grief and this need to finally let go of what\u2019s sort of holding you and in that moment for me at least that release that came when I saw that I was still here, you know, and that I wanted to live my life in a way that really showed that consciousness and appreciation that I was still here and I in that moment felt that I would need to be free enough to do things and possibly fail in order to become my fullest self, you know. \"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>In some ways, the self, as Lewis\u00a0imagines it, is developed and tested through a quest. She spoke about this striving as the engine behind creative work:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\"The quest is about that internal landscape, you know, that gap. What\u2019s making someone like William Faulkner publish <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=The Sound and the Fury\"><em>The Sound and the Fury<\/em><\/a> and still not be happy with it so he rewrites it five times and then republished an appendix, even though it\u2019s acclaimed and it\u2019s a success.

Let me just mention that he most cherishes &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F_zhVeZphwE\">One For My Baby<\/a>&rdquo; which he described as the greatest <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b19616231~S1\">torch song<\/a> EVER, sung with such underplayed emotion it rips your heart out every time. Not surprisingly there are other Sinatra&nbsp;lists like for example his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.besteveralbums.com\/thechart.php?b=885\">best albums<\/a>, where his 1955 LP &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b17768929~S1\">In The Wee Small Hours<\/a>&quot; sits in first place. And of course Sinatra appears on lists of all time&nbsp;best songs\/albums like for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/lists\/the-25-greatest-christmas-albums-of-all-time-20121219#ixzz3Sy5PqBSZ\">Rolling Stones&rsquo; Best Christmas albums<\/a> list where his &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b19420651~S1\">A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra<\/a>&quot;&nbsp;(1957) occupies no 13.\u2028<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of that success brought in good pay, but the beginnings of someone who eventually became a visionary when it comes to the business side of the music were tough. Michael Frontani&nbsp;(<em><a href=\"http:\/\/tm9qt7lg9g.search.serialssolutions.com\/?V=1.0&amp;N=100&amp;L=TM9QT7LG9G&amp;S=AC_T_B&amp;C=Journal+of+American+Culture\">The Journal of American Culture<\/a><\/em>, June 2005) stated that Sinatra sang in the Rustic Cabin, a roadhouse in <span class=\"st\">Englewood Cliffs, N.J.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; line-height: 1.5;\">, where he also waited tables and &lsquo;&lsquo;practically swept the floor,&rsquo;&rsquo; for $15 a week, but in 1939 he caught a break. Bandleader Harry James hired him as a featured vocalist. It was apparently a one-year contract for $75 a week. Six months later <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/search\/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;keywords=tommy+dorsey#\/?scroll=0\">Tommy Dorsey<\/a> bought Sinatra away from Harry at the price of $110 a week. Sinatra was sought after but was not making much as his <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/search~S1?\/dMusicians%27+contracts+--+United+States.\/dmusicians+contracts+united+states\/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB\/exact&amp;FF=dmusicians+contracts+united+states&amp;1%2C-1%2C\/indexsort=r\">contract<\/a> with Dorsey allegedly was very bad. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanmafia.com\/Feature_Articles_212.html\">John William Tuohy<\/a> claims that Dorsey took an incredible 33% of all of Sinatra&#39;s earnings. Dorsey&#39;s manager, Lenny Vannerson, took an additional 10%, and Sinatra&#39;s own agent took another 10%. Union memberships took another 30% so that 83% of money was going elsewhere. It was apparently so bad for Sinatra financially that he was forced to borrow money to buy a suit to make his stage appearances.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sinatra&rsquo;s popularity grew he first turned to artist unions for help to get out of this contract. It did not work. Sinatra later turned to Jules Stein who had founded MCA, the world&#39;s biggest theatrical agency. The official story has it that Stein was able to secure Sinatra&#39;s release for $60,000 in cash. However, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanmafia.com\/Feature_Articles_212.html\">John William Tuohy<\/a> there is a&nbsp;different version of these events, now part of popular lore, which has New Jersey&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b14392779~S1\">Mafia boss<\/a>, Guarino&nbsp;Moretti, better known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Willie_Moretti\">Willie Moretti<\/a> &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in the buyout. Needless to say it includes Moretti placing a gun in Dorsey&#39;s mouth to get the deal done, an event that no one ever was able to confirm, although Dorsey apparently told <em>American Mercury Magazine <\/em>in 1951 (after Moretti was killed) that he had signed the contract releasing Sinatra because he was paid and told &quot;Sign it or else!&quot; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how it happened in December of 1943 <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b10280050~S1\"><em>Newsweek<\/em><\/a> wrote:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>&quot;(...) the Music Corp. of America bought out Tommy Dorsey and Dorsey&rsquo;s manager, Leonard Vannerson, two of the biggest mortgage-holders, for $60,000, so Frankie at last got to eat some of what certainly isn&rsquo;t hay. His new radio show started in January over CBS, will bring him between $5,000 and $6,000 a week. Movies for the coming year should come to around $250,000 and record royalties to about $150,000. Best of all, though, is the current personal-appearance tour he now is making in Eastern key cities. For seven shows a day he is getting a $15,000 guarantee against 50 per cent of the gross&mdash;the biggest contract of its kind in the history of the business. In one week in Boston alone he made $30,000.&quot;<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a year later <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11158315~S1\"><em>New Republic<\/em><\/a> noted again that Sinatra&rsquo;s income was&nbsp;more than $20,000 a week and that in some busy weeks he earned as much as $30,000 which was about $4,300 per day! The sky was (not) the limit. &nbsp;It was more like &quot;<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 16.1200008392334px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YPvDjqqUrI4\">Fly me to the moon<\/a>.&nbsp;Let me play among the stars.&quot; <\/span>By the way, did you know that <a href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/50540\/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-frank-sinatra\">Sinatra has an asteroid named after him<\/a>?

It is&nbsp;a complicated question but there is an excellent online tool that helps with answer(s). It&#39;s called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.measuringworth.com\/uscompare\/\">MeasuringWorth.com<\/a>. When calculated as income or wealth $4,300 from 1944 could be as little as $56,900 or as much as $321,000 in 2013. Shocking?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what has Sinatra&nbsp;done with all the money? Well, what hasn&rsquo;t he done?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He bought a $250,000 home in Holmsby Hills and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S4tGQzo7r6A\">a place in Palm Springs<\/a>, for $162,000.&nbsp;He threw legendary champagne parties. He allegedly once said: &ldquo;Alcohol may be man&#39;s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also gave away <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?biw=1024&amp;bih=571&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Sinatra%27s+gold+Dunhill+lighters&amp;oq=Sinatra%27s+gold+Dunhill+lighters&amp;gs_l=img.12...32750.32998.0.34252.2.2.0.0.0.0.34.67.2.2.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.img..2.0.0.UCiNadUHFyo\">gold Dunhill lighters <\/a>($250 apiece).

Let me just mention that he most cherishes \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F_zhVeZphwE\" rel=\"nofollow\">One For My Baby<\/a>\u201d which he described as the greatest <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b19616231~S1\">torch song<\/a> EVER, sung with such underplayed emotion it rips your heart out every time. Not surprisingly there are other Sinatra\u00a0lists like for example his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.besteveralbums.com\/thechart.php?b=885\" rel=\"nofollow\">best albums<\/a>, where his 1955 LP \"<a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b17768929~S1\">In The Wee Small Hours<\/a>\" sits in first place. And of course Sinatra appears on lists of all time\u00a0best songs\/albums like for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/lists\/the-25-greatest-christmas-albums-of-all-time-20121219#ixzz3Sy5PqBSZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rolling Stones\u2019 Best Christmas albums<\/a> list where his \u00a0\"<a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b19420651~S1\">A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra<\/a>\"\u00a0(1957) occupies no 13.\u2028<\/p>\n\n<p>All of that success brought in good pay, but the beginnings of someone who eventually became a visionary when it comes to the business side of the music were tough. Michael Frontani\u00a0(<em><a href=\"http:\/\/tm9qt7lg9g.search.serialssolutions.com\/?V=1.0&amp;N=100&amp;L=TM9QT7LG9G&amp;S=AC_T_B&amp;C=Journal+of+American+Culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Journal of American Culture<\/a><\/em>, June 2005) stated that Sinatra sang in the Rustic Cabin, a roadhouse in <span class=\"st\">Englewood Cliffs, N.J.<\/span><span>, where he also waited tables and \u2018\u2018practically swept the floor,\u2019\u2019 for $15 a week, but in 1939 he caught a break. Bandleader Harry James hired him as a featured vocalist. It was apparently a one-year contract for $75 a week. Six months later <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/search\/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;keywords=tommy+dorsey#\/?scroll=0\">Tommy Dorsey<\/a> bought Sinatra away from Harry at the price of $110 a week. Sinatra was sought after but was not making much as his <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/search~S1?\/dMusicians%27+contracts+--+United+States.\/dmusicians+contracts+united+states\/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB\/exact&amp;FF=dmusicians+contracts+united+states&amp;1%2C-1%2C\/indexsort=r\">contract<\/a> with Dorsey allegedly was very bad. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanmafia.com\/Feature_Articles_212.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">John William Tuohy<\/a> claims that Dorsey took an incredible 33% of all of Sinatra's earnings. Dorsey's manager, Lenny Vannerson, took an additional 10%, and Sinatra's own agent took another 10%. Union memberships took another 30% so that 83% of money was going elsewhere. It was apparently so bad for Sinatra financially that he was forced to borrow money to buy a suit to make his stage appearances.<\/span>\n\n<\/p><p>When Sinatra\u2019s popularity grew he first turned to artist unions for help to get out of this contract. It did not work. Sinatra later turned to Jules Stein who had founded MCA, the world's biggest theatrical agency. The official story has it that Stein was able to secure Sinatra's release for $60,000 in cash. However, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanmafia.com\/Feature_Articles_212.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">John William Tuohy<\/a> there is a\u00a0different version of these events, now part of popular lore, which has New Jersey's <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b14392779~S1\">Mafia boss<\/a>, Guarino\u00a0Moretti, better known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Willie_Moretti\" rel=\"nofollow\">Willie Moretti<\/a> \u201cinvolved\u201d in the buyout. Needless to say it includes Moretti placing a gun in Dorsey's mouth to get the deal done, an event that no one ever was able to confirm, although Dorsey apparently told <em>American Mercury Magazine <\/em>in 1951 (after Moretti was killed) that he had signed the contract releasing Sinatra because he was paid and told \"Sign it or else!\" \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>No matter how it happened in December of 1943 <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b10280050~S1\"><em>Newsweek<\/em><\/a> wrote:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\"(...) the Music Corp. of America bought out Tommy Dorsey and Dorsey\u2019s manager, Leonard Vannerson, two of the biggest mortgage-holders, for $60,000, so Frankie at last got to eat some of what certainly isn\u2019t hay. His new radio show started in January over CBS, will bring him between $5,000 and $6,000 a week. Movies for the coming year should come to around $250,000 and record royalties to about $150,000. Best of all, though, is the current personal-appearance tour he now is making in Eastern key cities. For seven shows a day he is getting a $15,000 guarantee against 50 per cent of the gross\u2014the biggest contract of its kind in the history of the business. In one week in Boston alone he made $30,000.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Only a year later <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11158315~S1\"><em>New Republic<\/em><\/a> noted again that Sinatra\u2019s income was\u00a0more than $20,000 a week and that in some busy weeks he earned as much as $30,000 which was about $4,300 per day! The sky was (not) the limit. \u00a0It was more like \"<span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YPvDjqqUrI4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fly me to the moon<\/a>.\u00a0Let me play among the stars.\" <\/span>By the way, did you know that <a href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/50540\/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-frank-sinatra\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinatra has an asteroid named after him<\/a>?

Today let&rsquo;s just look at the Big Apple.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before it became a moniker for the city, &ldquo;big apple&rdquo; had other meanings. Throughout the nineteenth century, the term meant &ldquo;something regarded as the most significant of its kind; an object of desire and ambition.&rdquo; To &ldquo;bet a big apple&rdquo; was &ldquo;to state with supreme assurance; to be absolutely confident of&rdquo; [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/collections\/articles-databases\/oxford-english-dictionary-oed-2nd-edition\">Oxford English Dictionary<\/a>]. The term was popular enough that you see several nods to the colloquialism in the reporting of literally large apples. For example, the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12638689~S1\">Portland Advertiser<\/a><\/em> reports in 1840:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281480\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"114\",\"width\":\"300\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12609667~S1\">Boston Evening Transcript<\/a><\/em> in 1842:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281481\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"85\",\"width\":\"300\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Commercial_Advertiser\">Commercial Advertiser<\/a><\/em> places the term in quotes, possibly to highlight it in light of its common use (1848).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281482\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"56\",\"width\":\"300\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also plenty of examples of &nbsp;wagering or betting a big apple as a sure thing in newspapers in the 1800s. This one is from the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12639024~S1\">Salem Register<\/a><\/em>:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281483\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"158\",\"width\":\"300\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example from the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12639141~S1\">Boston Daily Globe<\/a><\/em> is an 1891 advertisement which read, &ldquo;We will wager a big red apple that the prices attached to our thousand and one styles are as low or lower than the same quality of goods can be bought elsewhere.&rdquo; Dozens of references to big apples and betting big apples can be found by searching digitized newspapers in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/collections\/articles-databases\/proquest-historical-database\">Proquest Historical Newspapers<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/chroniclingamerica.loc.gov\/\">Chronicling America<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/collections\/articles-databases\/americas-historical-newspapers\">America&rsquo;s Historical Newspapers<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/collections\/articles-databases\/oxford-english-dictionary-oed-2nd-edition\">Oxford English Dictionary<\/a> also reports its first known inference of New York in this context in 1909. Used only to imply a big and important place, &ldquo;the big apple city&rdquo; in context just happens to be New York. From Edward Martin&rsquo;s introduction in the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b16007744~S1\">Wayfarer in New York<\/a><\/em>: &nbsp;&ldquo;It [sc. the Mid-West] inclines to think that the big apple [sc.

He discussed the perception of New York City from other parts of the United States with an extended metaphor as though it were the fruit of a tree of which other &ldquo;lesser fruits&rdquo; are jealous and embittered.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281484\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"186\",\"width\":\"350\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why are apples so special in the 1800s? In <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11521053~S1\">Origin of New York City&#39;s nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;<\/a><\/em>, author Gerald Leonard Cohen explains that &ldquo;nowadays apples seem to be regarded as just another fruit, neither more nor less special than pears, grapefruits, etc. However, in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> and presumably the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century a big red apple was apparently something of special desirability,&rdquo; such as the gift of an apple for a teacher as a sign of flattery. Indeed, this is true. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbg.org\/\">Brooklyn Botanic Garden<\/a> explains how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbg.org\/gardening\/article\/the_apple_in_north_america\">the 19th century was the golden age of the apple<\/a>: &ldquo;an era known to fruit historians as the golden age of American pomology, a period running from the presidency of Thomas Jefferson to the Wright brothers&#39; liftoff at Kitty Hawk. It was a time of unparalleled public interest in new fruit varieties, when apples, pears, and peaches were critically reviewed and rated with the enthusiasm now reserved for Hollywood movies and popular music.&rdquo; Americans were seeing more apples than ever at the market and bigger, tastier specimens at that.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-left inline\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption digcol-image\"><a data-url=\"510d47dc-8b77-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\" href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47dc-8b77-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><img alt=\"Variety of Apples.

Image ID: 1107620<\/figcaption>\r\n\t<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Big Apple&rdquo; as a nickname for New York City really takes hold in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jazz_Age\">1920s jazz era<\/a>. The term, already in popular meaning as betting on a sure thing, makes its way to racetracks in the early 1920s. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_J._Fitz_Gerald\">John J. Fitz Gerald<\/a>, a reporter who wrote a regular racing column in the New York <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12639394~S1\">Morning Telegraph<\/a><\/em>, referred to the New York racing circuit as the Big Apple&mdash;a proper noun. He is credited for popularizing the term, and in 1924 he wrote, &ldquo;The Big Apple, the dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There&rsquo;s only one Big Apple. That&rsquo;s New York.&rdquo; Fitz Gerald&rsquo;s racing term complies with the original slang definition in his usage, since he is certainly expressing that he thinks the races are to be regarded as the most significant of their kind. Fitz Gerald titled the column &ldquo;Around the Big Apple.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the same decade, usage of the term shows up in other papers, often meaning the city of New York and not just its racing circuits. Chicago Defender, 1922: &ldquo;I trust your trip to the &lsquo;big apple&rsquo; was a huge success&hellip;&rdquo; and the <em>New York Times<\/em> uses it for the first time in an article about the slang that motion picture industry men use called &ldquo;Slang of Film Men,&rdquo; published March 11, 1928.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">[[{\"fid\":\"281485\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":\"188\",\"width\":\"300\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The term was popular amongst jazz musicians, and in <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11521053~S1\">Origin of New York City&#39;s nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;<\/a><\/em>, Cohen explains that when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/12\/06\/nyregion\/charles-gillett-80-the-creator-of-the-big-apple-ad-campaign.html\">Charles Gillett<\/a>, president of the non-profit New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, took interest in the phrase in the 1970s, he was inspired by its jazz connotations. Gillett ran a tourism campaign to invite tourists to New York in an era when the city&rsquo;s reputation was dominated by crime, bankruptcy, and middle class flight to the suburbs. The <em>New York Times<\/em> explains in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/12\/06\/nyregion\/charles-gillett-80-the-creator-of-the-big-apple-ad-campaign.html\">obituary<\/a>:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-right inline\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption digcol-image\"><a data-url=\"526847d0-c25a-0130-e3fe-58d385a7bbd0\" href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/526847d0-c25a-0130-e3fe-58d385a7bbd0\"><img alt=\"Skyline circa 1980.

A jazz fan, he remembered that musicians in the 1920s and &#39;30s had an expression for playing the big time after gigs in one-horse towns: &quot;There are many apples on the tree, but when you pick New York City, you pick the Big Apple.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gillett enlisted local celebrities to promote NYC, made Big Apple stickers and pins, and successfully recruited large organizations to bring their conventions to the city. When he retired, he received a New York State Governor&#39;s Award, with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo citing Gillett&#39;s &quot;long and distinguished service in promoting New York as the premier travel destination in the world,&quot; and for moving the bureau into the front ranks of local travel promotion agencies. By the time he passed away in the 1990s, Gillett was celebrated for his role in changing public opinion about visiting and living in NYC. The Big Apple campaign was successfully counter partnered with other 1970s publicity such as William Doyle and Milton Glaser&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I_Love_New_York\">I Love New York<\/a>&rdquo; campaign.

He discussed the perception of New York City from other parts of the United States with an extended metaphor as though it were the fruit of a tree of which other \u201clesser fruits\u201d are jealous and embittered.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img height=\"186\" width=\"350\" class=\"media-element file-default\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn-dev.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/The%20wayfarer%20in%20New%20York%20.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>So why are apples so special in the 1800s? In <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11521053~S1\">Origin of New York City's nickname \"The Big Apple\"<\/a><\/em>, author Gerald Leonard Cohen explains that \u201cnowadays apples seem to be regarded as just another fruit, neither more nor less special than pears, grapefruits, etc. However, in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> and presumably the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century a big red apple was apparently something of special desirability,\u201d such as the gift of an apple for a teacher as a sign of flattery. Indeed, this is true. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbg.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Botanic Garden<\/a> explains how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbg.org\/gardening\/article\/the_apple_in_north_america\" rel=\"nofollow\">the 19th century was the golden age of the apple<\/a>: \u201can era known to fruit historians as the golden age of American pomology, a period running from the presidency of Thomas Jefferson to the Wright brothers' liftoff at Kitty Hawk. It was a time of unparalleled public interest in new fruit varieties, when apples, pears, and peaches were critically reviewed and rated with the enthusiasm now reserved for Hollywood movies and popular music.\u201d Americans were seeing more apples than ever at the market and bigger, tastier specimens at that.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-left align-left inline inline\">\n\t<figure class=\"caption caption caption digcol-image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47dc-8b77-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><img alt=\" 1107620\" src=\"http:\/\/images.nypl.org\/index.php?id=1107620&amp;t=w\" width=\"200px\" \/><\/a>\n\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"digcol-caption\">Variety of Apples, 1812. Image ID: 1107620<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p>The \u201cBig Apple\u201d as a nickname for New York City really takes hold in the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jazz_Age\" rel=\"nofollow\">1920s jazz era<\/a>. The term, already in popular meaning as betting on a sure thing, makes its way to racetracks in the early 1920s. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_J._Fitz_Gerald\" rel=\"nofollow\">John J. Fitz Gerald<\/a>, a reporter who wrote a regular racing column in the New York <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b12639394~S1\">Morning Telegraph<\/a><\/em>, referred to the New York racing circuit as the Big Apple\u2014a proper noun. He is credited for popularizing the term, and in 1924 he wrote, \u201cThe Big Apple, the dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There\u2019s only one Big Apple. That\u2019s New York.\u201d Fitz Gerald\u2019s racing term complies with the original slang definition in his usage, since he is certainly expressing that he thinks the races are to be regarded as the most significant of their kind. Fitz Gerald titled the column \u201cAround the Big Apple.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Within the same decade, usage of the term shows up in other papers, often meaning the city of New York and not just its racing circuits. Chicago Defender, 1922: \u201cI trust your trip to the \u2018big apple\u2019 was a huge success\u2026\u201d and the <em>New York Times<\/em> uses it for the first time in an article about the slang that motion picture industry men use called \u201cSlang of Film Men,\u201d published March 11, 1928.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img height=\"188\" width=\"300\" class=\"media-element file-default\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn-dev.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/times%201928.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p><p>The term was popular amongst jazz musicians, and in <em><a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/record=b11521053~S1\">Origin of New York City's nickname \"The Big Apple\"<\/a><\/em>, Cohen explains that when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/12\/06\/nyregion\/charles-gillett-80-the-creator-of-the-big-apple-ad-campaign.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Gillett<\/a>, president of the non-profit New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, took interest in the phrase in the 1970s, he was inspired by its jazz connotations. Gillett ran a tourism campaign to invite tourists to New York in an era when the city\u2019s reputation was dominated by crime, bankruptcy, and middle class flight to the suburbs. The <em>New York Times<\/em> explains in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/12\/06\/nyregion\/charles-gillett-80-the-creator-of-the-big-apple-ad-campaign.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">obituary<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-right align-right inline inline\">\n\t<figure class=\"caption caption caption digcol-image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/526847d0-c25a-0130-e3fe-58d385a7bbd0\"><img alt=\" ps_lhg_151\" src=\"http:\/\/images.nypl.org\/index.php?id=ps_lhg_151&amp;t=w\" width=\"300px\" \/><\/a>\n\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"digcol-caption\">Skyline from World Trade Center looking north with closer view of Empire State Building, circa 1980. Image ID: ps_lhg_151<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p>\u201cBut perhaps his greatest success came with turning the term \"Big Apple\" into a tourist draw. A jazz fan, he remembered that musicians in the 1920s and '30s had an expression for playing the big time after gigs in one-horse towns: \"There are many apples on the tree, but when you pick New York City, you pick the Big Apple.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Gillett enlisted local celebrities to promote NYC, made Big Apple stickers and pins, and successfully recruited large organizations to bring their conventions to the city. When he retired, he received a New York State Governor's Award, with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo citing Gillett's \"long and distinguished service in promoting New York as the premier travel destination in the world,\" and for moving the bureau into the front ranks of local travel promotion agencies. By the time he passed away in the 1990s, Gillett was celebrated for his role in changing public opinion about visiting and living in NYC. The Big Apple campaign was successfully counter partnered with other 1970s publicity such as William Doyle and Milton Glaser\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/I_Love_New_York\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Love New York<\/a>\u201d campaign.

A veteran exhibitor of NYPL Libraries, BLUE brings extraodinary color and verve to her work, on display through April 28, 2015.

I find people very intriguing. I drew from live models for decades but I did not quite know how to turn this interest into a personal style. One day I saw a picture of a masked figure from the Venice Carnival. I mentioned to my partner that there was something about it that caught my fancy and since my partner has always been very supportive, she said to me: &quot;Just go.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was in 1993. It was the first Venice Carnival I attended and I knew I had found my subject&mdash;masked figures. I haven&#39;t missed a Venice Carnival since then. A critic once wrote: &quot;For this artist, everyday is Carnival.&quot; Another critic wrote that: &quot;One gets the impression that Mocerino&#39;s figures are never out of costume; that they live in a perpetual white-face persona.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What sort of emotions does you work evoke, or do you try and elicit from the viewer? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a viewer sees in my work is a very personal experience. They might not see what I see in it but they might find other ideas that they can relate to. And that&#39;s okay too. What I put into a painting is mystery, magic, passion, love, intensity of feeling, individualism, a quest to connect, a desire to soar above everyday&#39;s realities. Although my work is often labeled realism, I believe artists never do realism. As I see it, art should elevate us and teach us to search beyond the ordinary.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your name BLUE indicates a love of color, which is very evident in your work and style. Can you describe your relationship to color? What attracts you to color? Why BLUE?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can&#39;t imagine a world without color. It would be a very dull place indeed. I find that each color comes with its own characteristics. When I work with red, I feel the intensity and passion inherent in it. On the other hand, when I work with gold, I feel the heaviness of it and so on. I like strong, bold colors. I have a strong dislike of pastel colors. They will never find their way into my paintings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, earthy tones have been added to my palette. Although I paint with different colors, blue is the only color I wear. In the art world, you will find that the color artists wear at openings is black so I started to wear blue as sort of a rebellion against that rule. Soon enough though I found I lived very well in blue and that it started to shape who I am. I am very well at home in my blue life. Recently, I have adopted BLUE as my professional name.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"281376\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Best of New York \",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Best of New York \"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"The Best of New York \",\"title\":\"The Best of New York \",\"style\":\"float:right\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are some of your biggest artistic influences (could be art, writing, music, etc.)?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy has been my biggest artistic influence. As a matter of fact, Italy is at the core of my being an artist. I was twelve when my family and I emigrated to New York from Tuscany. At eighteen, I went back to Italy for a visit. I was on a train looking out at the countryside when this thought popped up from nowhere: &quot;I want to be an artist.&quot; And that was that. I have never looked back. My favorite author is <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=E.M. Forster\">E.M. Forster<\/a>. I have always needed a room with a view to survive. I have a great affinity to the operatic works of <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Giuseppe Verdi\">Giuseppe Verdi<\/a>&mdash;perhaps it&#39;s due to the fact that we share the same birthday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does travel inspire you?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel, like a good book, opens unexpected and unimaginable vistas. I can&#39;t help but think about what Grace Coddington of Vogue magazine said in the documentary, <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=The September Issue\"><em>The September Issue<\/em><\/a>: &quot;I worked with Norman Parkinson, who was a really big photographer. He taught me to always keep your eyes open; never go to sleep in the car; keep watching; whatever you see out the window or wherever, it can inspire you.&quot; Each city has its own unique palette&mdash;the color of the stones, the architecture of the buildings, the light as it hits the landscape through the day and at different seasons, the reflections in the water. I know that when I visit my favorite inspirational city, Venice, I often wonder if I will go blind from seeing so much beauty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you see NYC neighborhoods changing?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always loved to walk through the city. New York is a very dynamic city and neighborhoods change constantly. As artists find one neighborhood pricey, they move to another and there starts the beginning of the new Lower East Side, Williamsburg, Chelsea. And those artists who have made it big move to other areas like the West Village and the Meatpacking District. Then follow the restaurants, the bars, the boutiques and what we get is the Movida. The Spaniards use this word to describe neighborhoods with a lot of movement and a strong night life. I love it all!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"No. 5879\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22281377%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22No.%205879%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22No.%205879%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/no.%205879.jpg\" title=\"No. 5879\" width=\"300\"><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have shown work in many libraries at NYPL&mdash;why are you drawn to showing your work in Libraries? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I jokingly refer to this year as My Library Tour.

I wanted to take a break from the rigidity of a gallery setting and these libraries opened their doors to me. Three libraries, three different spaces, three different shows. What a fabulous opportunity to plan each show from beginning to end and to have the rare opportunity to hang one&#39;s own work. What a great chance to be part of what&#39;s happening in New York City by displaying my work in local libraries and making it accessible to all. Libraries are the dynamic center of a neighborhood; it&#39;s a perfect fit to have art and literature together with other local events. A heartfelt thanks to the staff of the libraries who have made The Library Tour possible.<\/p>\r\n","summary":"The Mulberry Street Library is proud to host the art exhibition \"Love, Masks, and Flowers\" by Greenwich Village based artist Rossella BLUE Mocerino.

I spoke with the artist about her work.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Venice \" class=\"media-element file-default\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/venice_0.jpg\" style=\"float:left\" title=\"Venice\" width=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us how you became interested in the masked figure as an artistic subject?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have always been interested in the human figure. I find people very intriguing. I drew from live models for decades but I did not quite know how to turn this interest into a personal style. One day I saw a picture of a masked figure from the Venice Carnival. I mentioned to my partner that there was something about it that caught my fancy and since my partner has always been very supportive, she said to me: \"Just go.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>That was in 1993. It was the first Venice Carnival I attended and I knew I had found my subject\u2014masked figures. I haven't missed a Venice Carnival since then. A critic once wrote: \"For this artist, everyday is Carnival.\" Another critic wrote that: \"One gets the impression that Mocerino's figures are never out of costume; that they live in a perpetual white-face persona.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What sort of emotions does you work evoke, or do you try and elicit from the viewer? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>What a viewer sees in my work is a very personal experience. They might not see what I see in it but they might find other ideas that they can relate to. And that's okay too. What I put into a painting is mystery, magic, passion, love, intensity of feeling, individualism, a quest to connect, a desire to soar above everyday's realities. Although my work is often labeled realism, I believe artists never do realism. As I see it, art should elevate us and teach us to search beyond the ordinary.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Your name BLUE indicates a love of color, which is very evident in your work and style. Can you describe your relationship to color? What attracts you to color? Why BLUE?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I can't imagine a world without color. It would be a very dull place indeed. I find that each color comes with its own characteristics. When I work with red, I feel the intensity and passion inherent in it. On the other hand, when I work with gold, I feel the heaviness of it and so on. I like strong, bold colors. I have a strong dislike of pastel colors. They will never find their way into my paintings.<\/p>\n\n<p>In recent years, earthy tones have been added to my palette. Although I paint with different colors, blue is the only color I wear. In the art world, you will find that the color artists wear at openings is black so I started to wear blue as sort of a rebellion against that rule. Soon enough though I found I lived very well in blue and that it started to shape who I am. I am very well at home in my blue life. Recently, I have adopted BLUE as my professional name.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Best of New York \" title=\"The Best of New York \" style=\"float:right\" class=\"media-element file-default\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn-dev.www.aws.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/the%20best%20of%20ny.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your biggest artistic influences (could be art, writing, music, etc.)?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Italy has been my biggest artistic influence. As a matter of fact, Italy is at the core of my being an artist. I was twelve when my family and I emigrated to New York from Tuscany. At eighteen, I went back to Italy for a visit. I was on a train looking out at the countryside when this thought popped up from nowhere: \"I want to be an artist.\" And that was that. I have never looked back. My favorite author is <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=E.M. Forster\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.M. Forster<\/a>. I have always needed a room with a view to survive. I have a great affinity to the operatic works of <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=Giuseppe Verdi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giuseppe Verdi<\/a>\u2014perhaps it's due to the fact that we share the same birthday.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does travel inspire you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Travel, like a good book, opens unexpected and unimaginable vistas. I can't help but think about what Grace Coddington of Vogue magazine said in the documentary, <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/search?t=smart&amp;search_category=keyword&amp;q=The September Issue\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The September Issue<\/em><\/a>: \"I worked with Norman Parkinson, who was a really big photographer. He taught me to always keep your eyes open; never go to sleep in the car; keep watching; whatever you see out the window or wherever, it can inspire you.\" Each city has its own unique palette\u2014the color of the stones, the architecture of the buildings, the light as it hits the landscape through the day and at different seasons, the reflections in the water. I know that when I visit my favorite inspirational city, Venice, I often wonder if I will go blind from seeing so much beauty.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you see NYC neighborhoods changing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I have always loved to walk through the city. New York is a very dynamic city and neighborhoods change constantly. As artists find one neighborhood pricey, they move to another and there starts the beginning of the new Lower East Side, Williamsburg, Chelsea. And those artists who have made it big move to other areas like the West Village and the Meatpacking District. Then follow the restaurants, the bars, the boutiques and what we get is the Movida. The Spaniards use this word to describe neighborhoods with a lot of movement and a strong night life. I love it all!<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"No. 5879\" class=\"media-element file-default\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/no.%205879.jpg\" title=\"No. 5879\" width=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>You have shown work in many libraries at NYPL\u2014why are you drawn to showing your work in Libraries? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I jokingly refer to this year as My Library Tour. I had a show in January at the <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.org\/locations\/tompkins-square\">Tompkins Square Library<\/a>, I am currently exhibiting at Mulberry Street Library until April 28th and I will complete this \"tour\" with a show at the <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.org\/locations\/hudson-park\">Hudson Park Library<\/a> in September. I wanted to take a break from the rigidity of a gallery setting and these libraries opened their doors to me. Three libraries, three different spaces, three different shows. What a fabulous opportunity to plan each show from beginning to end and to have the rare opportunity to hang one's own work. What a great chance to be part of what's happening in New York City by displaying my work in local libraries and making it accessible to all. Libraries are the dynamic center of a neighborhood; it's a perfect fit to have art and literature together with other local events. A heartfelt thanks to the staff of the libraries who have made The Library Tour possible.<\/p>\n","safe_summary":"The Mulberry Street Library is proud to host the art exhibition \"Love, Masks, and Flowers\" by Greenwich Village based artist Rossella BLUE Mocerino.

The term quantum refers to sub-atomic system changes that occur in certain discrete states where it denotes a sudden change from one energy state to another within an atom. The behavior of subatomic particles, \u00a0do not move smoothly from one state to another, when subjected to small increases in energy can move violently and\u00a0abruptly. Literally the\u00a0\u201cleap\u201d to a new state. We often hear the phrase to denote monumental change, in reality quantum leaps are subatomic, yet monumental all the same.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/quotbeam-me-upquot\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Beam Me Up\"\u00a0An experiment confirms that teleportation is possible\u2014at least for photons<\/a>, by Alan Hall. <em>Scientific American<\/em>, December 29, 1997.<br \/><br \/>\n\tIs it possible to consider <a href=\"http:\/\/catalog.nypl.org\/search~S1\/?searchtype=d&amp;searcharg=death&amp;searchscope=1&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xdeath%26SORT%3DDZ\">death<\/a> a one-way quantum leap?

Image ID: 1588252<\/figcaption>\r\n\t<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day has traditionally represented an important occasion for celebration amongst many, including my maternal relatives (my father&rsquo;s maternal grandfather hailed from ye old sod, but since my search for my paternal relations is at a most unfortunate standstill, I still suffer from a dearth of information regarding my paternal relations to properly know the extent, if any, to which they celebrate Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although my mother&rsquo;s ethnic heritage consisted of at least five diverse nations, our Irish heritage is the predominant ethnicity discussed and celebrated. (In fact, one year when I inquired as to further specifics regarding my maternal Scandinavian heritage, my mother&rsquo;s family shared a look of utter astonishment and disbelief, quickly followed up by scathing scowls, all focused in my direction, accompanied by the usual murmurs consisting of &ldquo;mix up at the hospital&rdquo; and &ldquo;likely takes after her father&rsquo;s side&hellip;&rdquo; And, I was coerced to fend off a maternal cousin who tried, yet again, to brush the inside of my cheek with a cotton swab. Additionally, my mother&rsquo;s relations have yet to forgive me for searching <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ancestrylibrary.com\/\">Ancestry.com Library Edition <\/a>with my nephew, Charles, a few years ago, as Charles discovered that one of my great-great-great grandmothers hailed from Scotland, not Ireland as family legend had indicated for so long.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I was not surprised when I received a telephone call from my male sibling, stating he was in the process of planning a vacation to Ireland this summer. My lack of surprise quickly morphed into utter disbelief and suspicion when my brother added, &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d like to go with us.&rdquo; I asked my brother to hold on, quickly depressing the play button on the tape recorder that I keep ever ready for his calls, and the apt lyrics of Sarah Bareilles&rsquo; <em>King of Anything <\/em>drifted over the phone wires. I rummaged around for my high blood pressure medicine, gulped down a capsule, and resumed my conversation with my male sibling. &ldquo;You know, Muriel, you&rsquo;re the only person that I know who has arranged for &lsquo;hold&rsquo; music to play on her telephone. And, even odder still, neither of my children have ever recalled hearing it when they call you.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you know just how fickle technology can be! Er, um, anyway, what is this about your visiting Ireland?&rdquo; My brother responded, &ldquo;Yes, well, as you know, we are of Irish descent&hellip;&rdquo; (A memory came, unbidden, of my being hastily shoved into a bathroom in my brother&rsquo;s abode when I commented to one of his visitors that my brother and I are also of, amongst several others, Swedish heritage.) &ldquo;&hellip;and I figured a sojourn to the Emerald Isle would be ideal for my kids. You know, both are redheads&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Just like Daddy,&rdquo; I interrupted, with more than a smattering of <em>Schadenfreud, <\/em>as my brother, for reasons that would very likely have stymied Sigmund Freud, detests any (valid) comparison of his children to their paternal grandfather. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, whatever. Anyway, if you&rsquo;d like to join us&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; I interjected, &ldquo;what is the flight pattern of the relevant airplane? Venturing anywhere near the Bermuda Triangle, is it?&rdquo; (Professional courtesy would prevent any ogre from devouring my brother, so he would experience no trepidation in flying over that notorious air space.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-left inline\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption digcol-image\"><a data-url=\"510d47e3-529e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\" href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47e3-529e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><img alt=\"The day that makes March famous,...

Image ID: 1588194<\/figcaption>\r\n\t<\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>A trifle too expeditiously for my comfort, my brother chuckled and responded that insofar as he was aware, the airplane to Ireland would not fly over the Bermuda Triangle. &ldquo;You know I am a fairly adept swimmer,&rdquo; I stated, as visions of my floating face down in the Irish Sea danced in my head. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know&rdquo; he replied, again, a tad too hastily. My brother interrupted my silent ruminations regarding the various methods of which he was probably plotting my demise on Irish soil when he interrupted my train of thought by stating, &ldquo;Hold on. I have to run to the bathroom.&rdquo; The mental imagery of my brother calling out,&ldquo;Ooops! How do you say, &#39;That&rsquo;s why they call me &lsquo;Ol Butterfingers&#39; in the Irish form of Gaelic?&rdquo; as I plummeted several stories to my death from the famous site of osculation, the Blarney Stone, was interrupted by the voice of my niece. &ldquo;Hi, auntie!&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Er, hi, Amanda. I didn&rsquo;t realize you were home.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Daddy wasn&rsquo;t expecting me home tonight, as I was sleeping over Emma&rsquo;s house, but she suffered an asthma attack, so I figured I&rsquo;d just head on home.&rdquo; Without pausing for oxygen, my niece blurted out, &ldquo;Hey, did Daddy inform you about that virulent former <em>Sinn Fein <\/em>member who bears an uncanny resemblance to you? She is currently an internationally &lsquo;Most Wanted&rsquo; fugitive. We stumbled across her photograph on the Internet while we were planning our family vacation to Ireland this summer. After my brother stated that he could certainly understand if Scotland Yard, in a case of mistaken identity, arrested you and tossed away the key, my father developed this strange gleam in his eye.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh he did, did he?&rdquo; Squelching my fury and, as usual compartmentalizing it for the sake of my relationship with my nephew and niece, I temporarily allowed the matter of my brother&rsquo;s latest attempt to decimate my life lie fallow. After chatting with my niece concerning her schoolwork, my brother began speaking to me again on the phone. &ldquo;So, think you want to journey with us to Ireland?&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a deep breath so as to insure I retained sufficient oxygen to complete my next sentence without interruption, I said, &ldquo;Do you know, dearest brother of mine, that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scotsman.com\/lifestyle\/heritage\/expert-argues-vikings-carried-redhead-gene-to-scotland-1-3200177\">I heard that all red hair originated from the Vikings<\/a>? And do you know that there was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sott.net\/article\/263587-DNA-shows-Irish-people-have-more-complex-origins-than-previously-thought\">an article on the Internet that stated that DNA technology revealed that one of the earliest inhabitants of Ireland was not Celtic in origin but from the Basque region of Spain<\/a>?&rdquo; I heard an anguished wail from the other end of the line followed up by my brother hurriedly stating, &ldquo;Er, um, I have to go.&rdquo; When I reminded him he just visited the bathroom, he said rather unconvincingly, &ldquo;Um, er, I am thirsty! I need a glass of water.&rdquo; I shouted out, <em>&quot;Slainte&quot; <\/em>(&quot;good health&quot; in Irish Gaelic!) before disconnecting the line. Certain family maternal family members notwithstanding, the Irish on the other side (of the Atlantic Ocean) as well as those scattered across other regions of the globe enjoy a lovely, lyrical, riveting history.

\/><\/a>\n\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"digcol-caption\">St Patrick's Day in the morning. Image ID: 1588252<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p>Saint Patrick\u2019s Day has traditionally represented an important occasion for celebration amongst many, including my maternal relatives (my father\u2019s maternal grandfather hailed from ye old sod, but since my search for my paternal relations is at a most unfortunate standstill, I still suffer from a dearth of information regarding my paternal relations to properly know the extent, if any, to which they celebrate Saint Patrick\u2019s Day).<\/p>\n\n<p>Although my mother\u2019s ethnic heritage consisted of at least five diverse nations, our Irish heritage is the predominant ethnicity discussed and celebrated. (In fact, one year when I inquired as to further specifics regarding my maternal Scandinavian heritage, my mother\u2019s family shared a look of utter astonishment and disbelief, quickly followed up by scathing scowls, all focused in my direction, accompanied by the usual murmurs consisting of \u201cmix up at the hospital\u201d and \u201clikely takes after her father\u2019s side\u2026\u201d And, I was coerced to fend off a maternal cousin who tried, yet again, to brush the inside of my cheek with a cotton swab. Additionally, my mother\u2019s relations have yet to forgive me for searching <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ancestrylibrary.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ancestry.com Library Edition <\/a>with my nephew, Charles, a few years ago, as Charles discovered that one of my great-great-great grandmothers hailed from Scotland, not Ireland as family legend had indicated for so long.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, I was not surprised when I received a telephone call from my male sibling, stating he was in the process of planning a vacation to Ireland this summer. My lack of surprise quickly morphed into utter disbelief and suspicion when my brother added, \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to go with us.\u201d I asked my brother to hold on, quickly depressing the play button on the tape recorder that I keep ever ready for his calls, and the apt lyrics of Sarah Bareilles\u2019 <em>King of Anything <\/em>drifted over the phone wires. I rummaged around for my high blood pressure medicine, gulped down a capsule, and resumed my conversation with my male sibling. \u201cYou know, Muriel, you\u2019re the only person that I know who has arranged for \u2018hold\u2019 music to play on her telephone. And, even odder still, neither of my children have ever recalled hearing it when they call you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell, you know just how fickle technology can be! Er, um, anyway, what is this about your visiting Ireland?\u201d My brother responded, \u201cYes, well, as you know, we are of Irish descent\u2026\u201d (A memory came, unbidden, of my being hastily shoved into a bathroom in my brother\u2019s abode when I commented to one of his visitors that my brother and I are also of, amongst several others, Swedish heritage.) \u201c\u2026and I figured a sojourn to the Emerald Isle would be ideal for my kids. You know, both are redheads\u2026\u201d \u201cJust like Daddy,\u201d I interrupted, with more than a smattering of <em>Schadenfreud, <\/em>as my brother, for reasons that would very likely have stymied Sigmund Freud, detests any (valid) comparison of his children to their paternal grandfather. \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. Anyway, if you\u2019d like to join us\u2026\u201d \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I interjected, \u201cwhat is the flight pattern of the relevant airplane? Venturing anywhere near the Bermuda Triangle, is it?\u201d (Professional courtesy would prevent any ogre from devouring my brother, so he would experience no trepidation in flying over that notorious air space.)<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-left align-left inline inline\">\n\t<figure class=\"caption caption caption digcol-image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47e3-529e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><img alt=\" 1588194\" src=\"http:\/\/images.nypl.org\/index.php?id=1588194&amp;t=w\" width=\"200px\" \/><\/a>\n\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"digcol-caption\">The day that makes March famous,... Image ID: 1588194<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p>A trifle too expeditiously for my comfort, my brother chuckled and responded that insofar as he was aware, the airplane to Ireland would not fly over the Bermuda Triangle. \u201cYou know I am a fairly adept swimmer,\u201d I stated, as visions of my floating face down in the Irish Sea danced in my head. \u201cYes, yes, I know\u201d he replied, again, a tad too hastily. My brother interrupted my silent ruminations regarding the various methods of which he was probably plotting my demise on Irish soil when he interrupted my train of thought by stating, \u201cHold on. I have to run to the bathroom.\u201d The mental imagery of my brother calling out,\u201cOoops! How do you say, 'That\u2019s why they call me \u2018Ol Butterfingers' in the Irish form of Gaelic?\u201d as I plummeted several stories to my death from the famous site of osculation, the Blarney Stone, was interrupted by the voice of my niece. \u201cHi, auntie!\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cEr, hi, Amanda. I didn\u2019t realize you were home.\u201d \u201cOh, Daddy wasn\u2019t expecting me home tonight, as I was sleeping over Emma\u2019s house, but she suffered an asthma attack, so I figured I\u2019d just head on home.\u201d Without pausing for oxygen, my niece blurted out, \u201cHey, did Daddy inform you about that virulent former <em>Sinn Fein <\/em>member who bears an uncanny resemblance to you? She is currently an internationally \u2018Most Wanted\u2019 fugitive. We stumbled across her photograph on the Internet while we were planning our family vacation to Ireland this summer. After my brother stated that he could certainly understand if Scotland Yard, in a case of mistaken identity, arrested you and tossed away the key, my father developed this strange gleam in his eye.\u201d \u201cOh he did, did he?\u201d Squelching my fury and, as usual compartmentalizing it for the sake of my relationship with my nephew and niece, I temporarily allowed the matter of my brother\u2019s latest attempt to decimate my life lie fallow. After chatting with my niece concerning her schoolwork, my brother began speaking to me again on the phone. \u201cSo, think you want to journey with us to Ireland?\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>Taking a deep breath so as to insure I retained sufficient oxygen to complete my next sentence without interruption, I said, \u201cDo you know, dearest brother of mine, that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scotsman.com\/lifestyle\/heritage\/expert-argues-vikings-carried-redhead-gene-to-scotland-1-3200177\" rel=\"nofollow\">I heard that all red hair originated from the Vikings<\/a>? And do you know that there was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sott.net\/article\/263587-DNA-shows-Irish-people-have-more-complex-origins-than-previously-thought\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article on the Internet that stated that DNA technology revealed that one of the earliest inhabitants of Ireland was not Celtic in origin but from the Basque region of Spain<\/a>?\u201d I heard an anguished wail from the other end of the line followed up by my brother hurriedly stating, \u201cEr, um, I have to go.\u201d When I reminded him he just visited the bathroom, he said rather unconvincingly, \u201cUm, er, I am thirsty! I need a glass of water.\u201d I shouted out, <em>\"Slainte\" <\/em>(\"good health\" in Irish Gaelic!) before disconnecting the line. Certain family maternal family members notwithstanding, the Irish on the other side (of the Atlantic Ocean) as well as those scattered across other regions of the globe enjoy a lovely, lyrical, riveting history.

I think that the problems of this world will be a natural outgrowth of some artists&rsquo; practice and the celestial and ineffable will be the focus of others. Attempting to create mandates for the production of art in and of itself can be the death nail to creativity. I think the role of these institutions function best as inspiration for production, space making for production (i.e. artist residencies) and as an advocate for the art that is finally produced.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"display:inline-block\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22281173%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Titus%20Kaphar,%20Yet%20Another%20Fight%20for%20Rememberance,%202014,%20oil%20on%20canvas,%2060%20x%2048%20inches.%20COurtesy%20of%20Jack%20Shainman%20Gallery%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"506\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/0f7995cdaaa7d3af05b70c43584914ba.jpg\" title=\"Titus Kaphar, Yet Another Fight for Rememberance, 2014, oil on canvas, 60 x 48 inches.

I find myself trying to present a more nuanced version of what I know exists but what I don&rsquo;t often see in many museums or popular media. This draws me to discussions of absence, invisibility or erasure. In many of my projects, I rely on the research of folks who came before me and in their work I see an emphasis on re-memory that leave its residue on my work. I think it&rsquo;s important for this issue of re&shy;memory to be engaged beyond communities of color. Many of the works in this last exhibition address not exclusively, but fundamentally American challenges. It seems to me that there won&rsquo;t be significant progress until the entire nation takes on this issue of re&shy;memory.

It\u2019s these kinds of archives that often stand as my defense when I\u2019m told that the kind of imagery or narrative that I am drawing from doesn\u2019t exist.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you believe there needs to be a connection between contemporary resistance movements and the art and cultural production of Black artists? What space do Black cultural art institutions occupy within the landscape of contemporary art production?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think that that should be a dictate. I think that the problems of this world will be a natural outgrowth of some artists\u2019 practice and the celestial and ineffable will be the focus of others. Attempting to create mandates for the production of art in and of itself can be the death nail to creativity. I think the role of these institutions function best as inspiration for production, space making for production (i.e. artist residencies) and as an advocate for the art that is finally produced.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n\t<figure class=\"caption\" style=\"display:inline-block\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-file_info=\"%7B%22fid%22:%22281173%22,%22view_mode%22:%22default%22,%22fields%22:%7B%22format%22:%22default%22,%22field_file_image_alt_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22%22,%22field_file_image_title_text%5Bund%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D%22:%22Titus%20Kaphar,%20Yet%20Another%20Fight%20for%20Rememberance,%202014,%20oil%20on%20canvas,%2060%20x%2048%20inches.%20COurtesy%20of%20Jack%20Shainman%20Gallery%22%7D,%22type%22:%22media%22%7D\" height=\"506\" src=\"https:\/\/www.nypl.org\/sites\/default\/files\/0f7995cdaaa7d3af05b70c43584914ba.jpg\" title=\"Titus Kaphar, Yet Another Fight for Rememberance, 2014, oil on canvas, 60 x 48 inches.

In many of my projects, I rely on the research of folks who came before me and in their work I see an emphasis on re-memory that leave its residue on my work. I think it\u2019s important for this issue of re\u00admemory to be engaged beyond communities of color. Many of the works in this last exhibition address not exclusively, but fundamentally American challenges. It seems to me that there won\u2019t be significant progress until the entire nation takes on this issue of re\u00admemory. Otherwise, what happens is that certain groups in the country continue to write fictional histories and call them textbooks that gloss over the tragedies of American history.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/new.livestream.com\/schomburgcenter\/events\/3691812\">Watch the Livestream studio salon conversation between Titus Kaphar and Dr. Khalil G.

In a just world it should take its proper place as part of the Rodgers canon, and I hold out hopes that with the work that Sheldon and I have done on revising it, &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; will have a new life for future generations of musical lovers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with the basics, the score of &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; is filled with musical treasures; &ldquo;Away From You&rdquo; (which Andrew Lloyd Webber called one of the greatest of Rodgers ballads), &ldquo;No Song More Pleasing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;As Once I Loved You,&rdquo; to name but a few. &nbsp;These are gorgeous Rodgers melodies, married to the witty, always incisive lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, songs that tell a great story of a man driven by love, rage, and a need for an heir that could keep his England from falling apart into civil wars after his death. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of our musical is that of Henry VIII&rsquo;s desperate search for a male heir, and his relationship with his various wives and children. &nbsp;I chose to cover only the wives who bore him his three children. &nbsp;It is a story often told in film and TV but one worth retelling as a musical, indeed, Henry was something of a composer-musician himself. Sadly, during the preparation of &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; an ailing Richard Rodgers suffered one of the many serious illnesses that had plagued his later life. &nbsp;&nbsp;When we first met he was a far different man than the one who began writing the score and who later came to every rehearsal and performance. &nbsp;He was vigorous, witty, and enthusiastic at the start. &nbsp;Now, restricted to esophageal speech as a result of recent throat cancer surgery, Rodgers spoke through a hole in his throat with some difficulty. This formerly handsome, athletic man walked hesitantly and was attended by a nurse throughout the rehearsals. &nbsp;He had also suffered from a stroke which created problems with certain aspects of composing&mdash;problems he soon overcame. &nbsp;Sheldon, concerned about pleasing the legendary Rodgers discovered that Rodgers, for all his past glory, was equally nervous about his music being accepted by Sheldon. &nbsp;But soon their collaboration clicked, and it was a joy to hear the results of their work together. &nbsp;But for all his physical troubles Rodgers never lost his dignity or his humor. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leading role of Henry VIII was cast with the notable British actor Nicol Williamson. &nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulties with Mr. Williamson in rehearsal and on the road made work on the show with the famously temperamental actor quite challenging for its creators. I will never forget the day when Rodgers, seated beside me during a rehearsal looked in disgust as Williamson threw his expensive gold plated crown across the stage, smashing it in yet another tantrum, and Rodgers growled into my ear, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s every quarter inch a king.&rdquo; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I still recall that night before the New York opening when I sat alone at the bar at Sardis and a reporter from the Daily News came over to me and asked &nbsp;&ldquo;Sherman, what&rsquo;s a nice Jewish boy like you doing here drinking a martini on the eve of Yom Kippur?&rdquo; &nbsp;In my exhausted, smart-assed manner I replied that after a month on the road with Nicol Williamson one no longer believed in God. &nbsp;&nbsp;This injudicious remark was printed in the following morning&rsquo;s paper&mdash;the morning before our opening night. &nbsp;Williamson read it and refused to perform at the opening without my apology before the full cast, and taking Richard Rodgers advice I managed to squeeze by with a mea culpa for my indiscretion, but not for my statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; opened on Broadway after much torment on the road, there were splendid moments, many of them provided by a superb performance by Penny Fuller who played both Anne and the young Elizabeth, and a gloomy but appropriate musical debut as Princess Mary by the talented young Glenn Close who had been rejected for the leading role of Anne and Elizabeth because Rodgers who admired her acting, found her singing voice wanting. A wonderful Tom &nbsp;Aldredge&nbsp;played the fool Will Somers. &nbsp;Only one reviewer saw through the show&rsquo;s problems to its virtues; the notable theatre critic George Oppenheimer who described it as &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo; in a world that had just discovered the more seductive modern pleasures of &ldquo;A Chorus Line.&rdquo; &nbsp;We were beaten with cudgels by the Times, and it took years to heal from those wounds. I recovered before &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; did&mdash;and, as I noted, it went down in theater history as a failure. &nbsp;But that was not the end of &nbsp;&ldquo;Rex&rdquo; for Sheldon Harnick or for me.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jim Morgan, the artistic director of the York Theatre asked us&mdash;the sole survivors of the show&mdash;to look at &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; again for their Musicals in Mufti series, (their modestly staged book-in-hand staged readings of past musicals) we took it on as a challenge, a labor of love, claiming that we would not do &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; as it was but &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; as we had always intended it to be, a story of real people not mummers in a pageant. &nbsp;Jay Binder was the skillful director of a cast that was headed by Melissa Errico in the dual role of Ann\/Elizabeth and Patrick Page as Henry. &nbsp;It was our chance to cut through the heavy burdensome production with its crimson velvet drapery that dwarfed its characters rather than provided them with an environment to express what was most human or inhuman in them. &nbsp;We wanted to take the Madam Tussaud&rsquo;s waxworks characters of the original production and bring them back to a new life. Now we could focus our efforts on restoring what had been lost on its catastrophic trip to Broadway, its human drama and its glorious Rodgers\/Harnick songs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A judicious rearrangement of the score, the elimination of some clunky pseudo Elizabethan choreography, tossing aside a production number for the young Prince Edward that seemed to amuse the characters onstage more than the audience, and a careful reshaping of the book would eventually create a piece that was tighter, more coherent, a story of love gone wrong between a youthful, lovesick and charming Henry and an ambitious, cunning but sympathetic Anne. &nbsp;All this culminating in the Second Act struggle between an aging Henry and his young daughter Elizabeth, the child of Anne&rsquo;s&mdash;so like her father&mdash;whom he had declared his bastard after executing her allegedly adulterous mother after she had failed to provide him with a son and heir. We see a Henry, unable to remove the dynastic blinders that would show him an Elizabeth who was the natural heir to his throne, the very king he longed for: the one who could bring in a golden age for the England he loved. Thus Henry struggles until the end to avoid what is obvious to others, and yet deep within himself he knows the truth. &nbsp;Ours was truly a feminist musical, if one could look past Henry&rsquo;s misogyny, or perhaps look deep inside it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In revising the musical for the York I saw where I had failed to bind the disparate parts of Acts I and 2 together, and I found the remedy for that in a series of Elizabethan style poems that were performed by Will Somers, Henry&rsquo;s fool played at the York by the marvelous B.D. Wong, providing critical moments of transition in the musical. &nbsp;The fool&rsquo;s part was expanded and deepened, allowing Henry to express his inner thoughts to one he trusted above all, the one who dared to tell him the truth. &nbsp;And the bare stage of the York released these splendid actors to be the play, its characters, its scenery, its time in human history. &nbsp;Suddenly, it all came together, and in a future production it received great reviews in the Toronto press. It now awaits the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization to place it in the Rodgers canon where it rightfully belongs. And when they do so they will provide the world with a new Richard Rodgers musical, one that honors the 20th century&rsquo;s iconic musical composer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best of all our work on &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; would allow us to restore one of the greatest of Rodgers late life songs, &ldquo;The Pears of Anjou.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;This song was particularly important to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;It revealed Henry VIII&rsquo;s passion for life, even as he confronts death. &nbsp;While dying, Henry expresses his desire to live for yet another season to see and taste the exquisite pears of Anjou. &nbsp;In this song Henry questions his own life and its values, as death forces Henry to confront all his present pain, his past sins and his great pleasures, prodded by his faithful fool to face the reality of his life. &nbsp;It was a very personal statement from Richard Rodgers who was himself looking death in the eye and bravely trying to out-stare it. &nbsp;&nbsp;For Dick, writing the score to a new musical was the reason to stay alive, and the chance to express his remarkable melodic talents, the one gift that had not been taken from him by age and illness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rex,&rdquo; was his &ldquo;Pears of Anjou.&rdquo; &nbsp;Amazingly, he wrote two other musicals after ours, but &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; was his final great statement as an artist. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have surmised that Dick was my friend, and despite the theater lore that views him as a cold, musical machine, I found him to be a great and good man, a proud man at the end of his life, beset by existential doubts, as Henry was, as we all are. &nbsp;At that time of Sheldon and I were still young men, and we could not fully understand what he was enduring. &nbsp;With Sheldon and I now older than Richard Rodgers was at the time of &ldquo;Rex,&rdquo; we understand all too well the need for work as a key to living well beyond your shelf-life. &nbsp;Alas, that penultimate song about &ldquo;The Pears of Anjou&rdquo; had been cut from the musical before it ever opened on Broadway&mdash;exiled by its performer and director, robbing the show of its greatest dramatic and musical moment in order to quicken the pace towards the end. &nbsp;That splendid song is now restored, correcting a tragic error, and it was included in the York performance and for the Toronto stage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years later while preparing the revitalized &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; for the York reading I added fresh material for Henry&rsquo;s fool, material that gingerly guides the audience into the world of the Tudors and carries them through those palace corridors with humor and style. &nbsp;&nbsp;Sheldon rearranged the score, pruning and adding where necessary, giving the score a dramatic shape that it lacked when it opened. &nbsp;Without the pressures of that ill-starred original production it was a joy to work together on the piece, to restore it and to revise it, and make it accessible for a new audience. At the end of our labors, Sheldon sent me a note that spoke of his delight in finally vindicating this musical for us and mainly for Richard Rodgers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very absence of a set in the York staged reading proved to be a great virtue. &nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; looked like a play set in the Globe Theatre of Shakespeare, and that inspired us with the idea of how it could best be done in any future production&mdash;with an austere simplicity, depending solely on the power of its actors and its material&mdash;eschewing the tendency to recreate the world of Henry with a gilded splendor that only buried the characters in royal party costumes. &nbsp;The later performances of actors who played their roles with humor and humanity; actors who were not doing star turns but giving the text and the songs the best possible reading enhanced the musical further. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After forty odd years I still cherish my memories of working with Rodgers, and the grace with which he faced a &ldquo;failure&rdquo; as much as the joy with which he celebrated his success after completing a song. &nbsp;&nbsp;A day after the Times critic blasted us Rodgers called me and asked if we could always be friends. &nbsp;This is a rarity in theater where people walk away from friendships formed during the show&mdash;particularly a failed show that brings with it public humiliation. &nbsp;It was an honor for me and for my wife to consider Richard and Dorothy Rodgers our friends for life. I have gone on to write several musicals some as librettist, others as a lyricist, but for all the joys that came with those shows, and there were many, &ldquo;Rex&rdquo; remains the one that is indelibly printed on my psyche. &nbsp;&ldquo;Rex&rdquo; is no failure for me. &nbsp;It remains for all its travails and disappointments one of my life&rsquo;s exhilarating experiences in theater. And,for me, a splendid success.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Sherman Yellen is the author of the recently published memoir, Cousin Bella: The Whore of Minsk, and the soon to be published &ldquo;Spotless&rdquo;&mdash;his memoir of his New York boyhood in the 1930s and 1940s. &nbsp;He is also the author of &ldquo;December Fools and Other Plays&rdquo;&mdash;a collection of plays with an introduction by Sheldon Harnick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A note on the text<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>All of the archival images at the link below are made available through the kind permission of the rights holders [Sherman Yellen and&nbsp;Sheldon Harnick] for research use only.

Sadly, during the preparation of \u201cRex\u201d an ailing Richard Rodgers suffered one of the many serious illnesses that had plagued his later life. \u00a0\u00a0When we first met he was a far different man than the one who began writing the score and who later came to every rehearsal and performance. \u00a0He was vigorous, witty, and enthusiastic at the start. \u00a0Now, restricted to esophageal speech as a result of recent throat cancer surgery, Rodgers spoke through a hole in his throat with some difficulty. This formerly handsome, athletic man walked hesitantly and was attended by a nurse throughout the rehearsals. \u00a0He had also suffered from a stroke which created problems with certain aspects of composing\u2014problems he soon overcame. \u00a0Sheldon, concerned about pleasing the legendary Rodgers discovered that Rodgers, for all his past glory, was equally nervous about his music being accepted by Sheldon. \u00a0But soon their collaboration clicked, and it was a joy to hear the results of their work together. \u00a0But for all his physical troubles Rodgers never lost his dignity or his humor. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>The leading role of Henry VIII was cast with the notable British actor Nicol Williamson. \u00a0\u00a0Difficulties with Mr. Williamson in rehearsal and on the road made work on the show with the famously temperamental actor quite challenging for its creators. I will never forget the day when Rodgers, seated beside me during a rehearsal looked in disgust as Williamson threw his expensive gold plated crown across the stage, smashing it in yet another tantrum, and Rodgers growled into my ear, \u201cHe\u2019s every quarter inch a king.\u201d \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>I still recall that night before the New York opening when I sat alone at the bar at Sardis and a reporter from the Daily News came over to me and asked \u00a0\u201cSherman, what\u2019s a nice Jewish boy like you doing here drinking a martini on the eve of Yom Kippur?\u201d \u00a0In my exhausted, smart-assed manner I replied that after a month on the road with Nicol Williamson one no longer believed in God. \u00a0\u00a0This injudicious remark was printed in the following morning\u2019s paper\u2014the morning before our opening night. \u00a0Williamson read it and refused to perform at the opening without my apology before the full cast, and taking Richard Rodgers advice I managed to squeeze by with a mea culpa for my indiscretion, but not for my statement.<\/p>\n\n<p>When \u201cRex\u201d opened on Broadway after much torment on the road, there were splendid moments, many of them provided by a superb performance by Penny Fuller who played both Anne and the young Elizabeth, and a gloomy but appropriate musical debut as Princess Mary by the talented young Glenn Close who had been rejected for the leading role of Anne and Elizabeth because Rodgers who admired her acting, found her singing voice wanting. A wonderful Tom \u00a0Aldredge\u00a0played the fool Will Somers. \u00a0Only one reviewer saw through the show\u2019s problems to its virtues; the notable theatre critic George Oppenheimer who described it as \u201cmagnificent\u201d in a world that had just discovered the more seductive modern pleasures of \u201cA Chorus Line.\u201d \u00a0We were beaten with cudgels by the Times, and it took years to heal from those wounds. I recovered before \u201cRex\u201d did\u2014and, as I noted, it went down in theater history as a failure. \u00a0But that was not the end of \u00a0\u201cRex\u201d for Sheldon Harnick or for me.<\/p>\n\n<p>When Jim Morgan, the artistic director of the York Theatre asked us\u2014the sole survivors of the show\u2014to look at \u201cRex\u201d again for their Musicals in Mufti series, (their modestly staged book-in-hand staged readings of past musicals) we took it on as a challenge, a labor of love, claiming that we would not do \u201cRex\u201d as it was but \u201cRex\u201d as we had always intended it to be, a story of real people not mummers in a pageant. \u00a0Jay Binder was the skillful director of a cast that was headed by Melissa Errico in the dual role of Ann\/Elizabeth and Patrick Page as Henry. \u00a0It was our chance to cut through the heavy burdensome production with its crimson velvet drapery that dwarfed its characters rather than provided them with an environment to express what was most human or inhuman in them. \u00a0We wanted to take the Madam Tussaud\u2019s waxworks characters of the original production and bring them back to a new life. Now we could focus our efforts on restoring what had been lost on its catastrophic trip to Broadway, its human drama and its glorious Rodgers\/Harnick songs.<\/p>\n\n<p>A judicious rearrangement of the score, the elimination of some clunky pseudo Elizabethan choreography, tossing aside a production number for the young Prince Edward that seemed to amuse the characters onstage more than the audience, and a careful reshaping of the book would eventually create a piece that was tighter, more coherent, a story of love gone wrong between a youthful, lovesick and charming Henry and an ambitious, cunning but sympathetic Anne. \u00a0All this culminating in the Second Act struggle between an aging Henry and his young daughter Elizabeth, the child of Anne\u2019s\u2014so like her father\u2014whom he had declared his bastard after executing her allegedly adulterous mother after she had failed to provide him with a son and heir. We see a Henry, unable to remove the dynastic blinders that would show him an Elizabeth who was the natural heir to his throne, the very king he longed for: the one who could bring in a golden age for the England he loved. Thus Henry struggles until the end to avoid what is obvious to others, and yet deep within himself he knows the truth. \u00a0Ours was truly a feminist musical, if one could look past Henry\u2019s misogyny, or perhaps look deep inside it. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>In revising the musical for the York I saw where I had failed to bind the disparate parts of Acts I and 2 together, and I found the remedy for that in a series of Elizabethan style poems that were performed by Will Somers, Henry\u2019s fool played at the York by the marvelous B.D. Wong, providing critical moments of transition in the musical. \u00a0The fool\u2019s part was expanded and deepened, allowing Henry to express his inner thoughts to one he trusted above all, the one who dared to tell him the truth. \u00a0And the bare stage of the York released these splendid actors to be the play, its characters, its scenery, its time in human history. \u00a0Suddenly, it all came together, and in a future production it received great reviews in the Toronto press. It now awaits the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization to place it in the Rodgers canon where it rightfully belongs. And when they do so they will provide the world with a new Richard Rodgers musical, one that honors the 20th century\u2019s iconic musical composer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Best of all our work on \u201cRex\u201d would allow us to restore one of the greatest of Rodgers late life songs, \u201cThe Pears of Anjou.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0This song was particularly important to us. \u00a0\u00a0It revealed Henry VIII\u2019s passion for life, even as he confronts death. \u00a0While dying, Henry expresses his desire to live for yet another season to see and taste the exquisite pears of Anjou. \u00a0In this song Henry questions his own life and its values, as death forces Henry to confront all his present pain, his past sins and his great pleasures, prodded by his faithful fool to face the reality of his life. \u00a0It was a very personal statement from Richard Rodgers who was himself looking death in the eye and bravely trying to out-stare it. \u00a0\u00a0For Dick, writing the score to a new musical was the reason to stay alive, and the chance to express his remarkable melodic talents, the one gift that had not been taken from him by age and illness. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cRex,\u201d was his \u201cPears of Anjou.\u201d \u00a0Amazingly, he wrote two other musicals after ours, but \u201cRex\u201d was his final great statement as an artist. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>You may have surmised that Dick was my friend, and despite the theater lore that views him as a cold, musical machine, I found him to be a great and good man, a proud man at the end of his life, beset by existential doubts, as Henry was, as we all are. \u00a0At that time of Sheldon and I were still young men, and we could not fully understand what he was enduring. \u00a0With Sheldon and I now older than Richard Rodgers was at the time of \u201cRex,\u201d we understand all too well the need for work as a key to living well beyond your shelf-life. \u00a0Alas, that penultimate song about \u201cThe Pears of Anjou\u201d had been cut from the musical before it ever opened on Broadway\u2014exiled by its performer and director, robbing the show of its greatest dramatic and musical moment in order to quicken the pace towards the end. \u00a0That splendid song is now restored, correcting a tragic error, and it was included in the York performance and for the Toronto stage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Years later while preparing the revitalized \u201cRex\u201d for the York reading I added fresh material for Henry\u2019s fool, material that gingerly guides the audience into the world of the Tudors and carries them through those palace corridors with humor and style. \u00a0\u00a0Sheldon rearranged the score, pruning and adding where necessary, giving the score a dramatic shape that it lacked when it opened. \u00a0Without the pressures of that ill-starred original production it was a joy to work together on the piece, to restore it and to revise it, and make it accessible for a new audience. At the end of our labors, Sheldon sent me a note that spoke of his delight in finally vindicating this musical for us and mainly for Richard Rodgers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The very absence of a set in the York staged reading proved to be a great virtue. \u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, \u201cRex\u201d looked like a play set in the Globe Theatre of Shakespeare, and that inspired us with the idea of how it could best be done in any future production\u2014with an austere simplicity, depending solely on the power of its actors and its material\u2014eschewing the tendency to recreate the world of Henry with a gilded splendor that only buried the characters in royal party costumes. \u00a0The later performances of actors who played their roles with humor and humanity; actors who were not doing star turns but giving the text and the songs the best possible reading enhanced the musical further. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>After forty odd years I still cherish my memories of working with Rodgers, and the grace with which he faced a \u201cfailure\u201d as much as the joy with which he celebrated his success after completing a song. \u00a0\u00a0A day after the Times critic blasted us Rodgers called me and asked if we could always be friends. \u00a0This is a rarity in theater where people walk away from friendships formed during the show\u2014particularly a failed show that brings with it public humiliation. \u00a0It was an honor for me and for my wife to consider Richard and Dorothy Rodgers our friends for life. I have gone on to write several musicals some as librettist, others as a lyricist, but for all the joys that came with those shows, and there were many, \u201cRex\u201d remains the one that is indelibly printed on my psyche. \u00a0\u201cRex\u201d is no failure for me. \u00a0It remains for all its travails and disappointments one of my life\u2019s exhilarating experiences in theater. And,for me, a splendid success.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sherman Yellen is the author of the recently published memoir, Cousin Bella: The Whore of Minsk, and the soon to be published \u201cSpotless\u201d\u2014his memoir of his New York boyhood in the 1930s and 1940s. \u00a0He is also the author of \u201cDecember Fools and Other Plays\u201d\u2014a collection of plays with an introduction by Sheldon Harnick. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/em>\n\n<\/p><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A note on the text<\/h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>All of the archival images at the link below are made available through the kind permission of the rights holders [Sherman Yellen and\u00a0Sheldon Harnick] for research use only.

You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d be used to waiting for <em><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20295729052907_outlander\">Outlander<\/a><\/em> by now. &nbsp;Way way back, in 1990, I wandered into a Portland, Oregon bookstore and found a romance novel, set in Scotland, involving time travel and I was hooked! Since then, it&rsquo;s been a 25 year odyssey of reading (including eight novels, three companion novels, eight novellas\/ short stories and one graphic novel) and waiting. Waiting for the next to book come along and waiting for it to be turned into a film or TV series. For fans, like me, it&rsquo;s been excruciating. I&rsquo;ve had to find ways to cope:&nbsp;hunt down readalikes and other things to read or&nbsp;watch to fill in the gaps as I waited patiently (ahem). Now for those fans currently waiting and anticipating, I will pass on what I&rsquo;ve discovered,&nbsp;over the years, to you. &nbsp;#Droughtlander<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">First, for the uninitiated, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20295729052907_outlander\">Outlander<\/a><\/em> (by Diana Gabaldon) is an epic tale of adventure and romance set in 18<sup>th<\/sup> century Scotland. It opens in the Scottish Highlands of 1946 where Englishwoman and nurse, Claire Randall and her husband Frank are on their second honeymoon. While visiting a circle of standing stones alone, Claire falls through time to 1743. There she meets the British officer ancestor of her husband and becomes involved in local politics which causes her to be forcibly wed to a young highlander named Jamie Fraser. As she tries to figure out a way home, she begins to fall in love with her new husband and tries to stop the uprising that will lead to the tragic Scottish losses at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">To dismiss it as straight historical romance, is to do it a disservice. Yes, the romance is full of steamy swoon but the characters are more than well matched. The story is epic and&nbsp;full of wonderful, historical details of 18th century Scotland and with Claire, it has one of the best female characters I&rsquo;ve ever come across. I love the fact that the time travel just happens but I know that it bothers some people. My advice? Just go with it and don&rsquo;t question it. It eventually gets explained. This is fun, escapist literature at its most educational. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">Now lets get started. I&#39;ve broken down all the reasons why I love the series (and included the series itself) and put together lists of readalikes based on those reasons. It&#39;s all very scientific. &nbsp;The symbol (*) indicates&nbsp;<\/span>titles not owned by NYPL and&nbsp;non-circulating &nbsp;titles at NYPL. Hopefully we can remedy this soon!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">Outlander series<\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">If you haven&rsquo;t yet read the <em>Outlander<\/em> books, start now. Most of them top out at about 800 pages (more or less). They are a treasure trove of epic proportions and take you from Scotland to France to a very new&nbsp;America and span time and history. I also suggest the novellas that flesh out secondary and tertiary characters and related action.

Since then, it\u2019s been a 25 year odyssey of reading (including eight novels, three companion novels, eight novellas\/ short stories and one graphic novel) and waiting. Waiting for the next to book come along and waiting for it to be turned into a film or TV series. For fans, like me, it\u2019s been excruciating. I\u2019ve had to find ways to cope:\u00a0hunt down readalikes and other things to read or\u00a0watch to fill in the gaps as I waited patiently (ahem). Now for those fans currently waiting and anticipating, I will pass on what I\u2019ve discovered,\u00a0over the years, to you. \u00a0#Droughtlander<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">First, for the uninitiated, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.bibliocommons.com\/item\/show\/20295729052907_outlander\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outlander<\/a><\/em> (by Diana Gabaldon) is an epic tale of adventure and romance set in 18<sup>th<\/sup> century Scotland. It opens in the Scottish Highlands of 1946 where Englishwoman and nurse, Claire Randall and her husband Frank are on their second honeymoon. While visiting a circle of standing stones alone, Claire falls through time to 1743. There she meets the British officer ancestor of her husband and becomes involved in local politics which causes her to be forcibly wed to a young highlander named Jamie Fraser. As she tries to figure out a way home, she begins to fall in love with her new husband and tries to stop the uprising that will lead to the tragic Scottish losses at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">To dismiss it as straight historical romance, is to do it a disservice. Yes, the romance is full of steamy swoon but the characters are more than well matched. The story is epic and\u00a0full of wonderful, historical details of 18th century Scotland and with Claire, it has one of the best female characters I\u2019ve ever come across. I love the fact that the time travel just happens but I know that it bothers some people. My advice? Just go with it and don\u2019t question it. It eventually gets explained. This is fun, escapist literature at its most educational. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">Now lets get started. I've broken down all the reasons why I love the series (and included the series itself) and put together lists of readalikes based on those reasons. It's all very scientific. \u00a0The symbol (*) indicates\u00a0<\/span>titles not owned by NYPL and\u00a0non-circulating \u00a0titles at NYPL. Hopefully we can remedy this soon!<\/p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">Outlander series<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce5e70ba-cc4c-ccec-40bc-4be37abf593b\">If you haven\u2019t yet read the <em>Outlander<\/em> books, start now. Most of them top out at about 800 pages (more or less). They are a treasure trove of epic proportions and take you from Scotland to France to a very new\u00a0America and span time and history. I also suggest the novellas that flesh out secondary and tertiary characters and related action. I particularly love the Lord John mysteries\/ adventures but they do include homosexual love scenes which may not be for everyone. If you start on these books you should be occupied for oh, a few years at the very least! But even this list is incomplete.

Although the Schomburg Center did not start collecting moving&nbsp;image and recorded sound materials until the 1970s, the items in this exhibition fit&nbsp;squarely into Schomburg\u02bcs original mission by literally giving movement and voice&nbsp;to black history and culture.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided by these principles, and as a new curator still getting to know the 5,000-cubic-square foot collection, I focused my curatorial lens on items that revealed or&nbsp;reminded me of black agency, ingenuity, and voice. For example, there the award-winning but little seen documentary that is centered in heart of the Civil Rights&nbsp;struggle titled <em>King: A Filmed Record...Montgomery to Memphis<\/em> (1970). To mark the&nbsp;50th anniversary of the march from Selma to Montgomery, those vivid scenes are&nbsp;projected large scale on a wall in our Latimer\/Edison Gallery. Also featured is audio&nbsp;recorded by artist and Selma participant Ken Dewey, who offers an exploration into&nbsp;the raw landscape.

In the spirit of the week, we would like to share some information for teens about devices, software, and Internet resources.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Think Before You Post<\/strong><br>\r\n\tIt only takes a few seconds for someone to take a screenshot of Facebook.&nbsp;Any pictures that get posted to Instagram or texted to your friends can still circulate even after you take them down.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Format Painter is Your Friend<\/strong><br>\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;ve cut and pasted web information into Microsoft Word, the fonts and spacing will vary from line to line. To use the format painter, highlight a line with the font that you want, click <a href=\"https:\/\/support.office.com\/en-za\/article\/Use-the-Format-Painter-4bb415a9-d4e4-42b7-b579-170adc594e40\">Format Painter<\/a> on the left side of the Home tab, and highlight the rest of the text. It will copy all of the formatting onto the new text so everything will be the same.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Save Your Warranties<\/strong><br>\r\n\tWhenever you purchase a phone or computer, you get a booklet called a warranty. It states how many years from the purchase date you can get your items fixed or replaced for free. Hold onto your receipt as well. If something goes wrong within the first 1-2 years like a broken screen or a faulty battery, you can get it replaced for free if you show technician your receipt and warranty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Make Use of Free Computers and Books<\/strong><br>\r\n\tMany branches of NYPL have computer labs specifically for teens or programs like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/events\/classes\/calendar?keyword=teen+tech+time&amp;location=&amp;topic=&amp;audience=&amp;series=&amp;date_op=GREATER_EQUAL&amp;date1=03%2F03%2F2015\" target=\"_blank\">Teen Tech Time<\/a>&nbsp;where you can borrow a laptop or get help with using the library&#39;s online resources.&nbsp;We also offer free <a href=\"http:\/\/hotspot.nypl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi hotspots<\/a> for checkout for patrons who qualify. If you need a specific book for your homework, it is not available for borrowing, we have a lot of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/ebooks\" target=\"_blank\">e-books<\/a> that you can download to your computer for free or read online.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Unplug Your Devices<\/strong><br>\r\n\tKeeping your cell phone on 24\/7 will cause wear and tear on the battery. Turning your phone off for a little while can save you from having to change the battery after a few months.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Log Out, Sign Off<\/strong><br>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s easy to leave your computer without signing out of Facebook, but we&rsquo;ve all seen silly statuses posted by friends who saw their pal&rsquo;s open Facebook page. Take the extra second to log off any sites that you&rsquo;re signed into once you&rsquo;re done. &nbsp;The same thing goes if you have a phone or music player. Make a passcode and always hit the &ldquo;off&rdquo; button to engage the lock screen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Find Free (and legal!) Music<\/strong><br>\r\n\tTracks for 99 cents and albums for $7.99 can seem cheap but can really add up over time. Join sites that offer free streaming or limited free downloads like Spotify, Qtrax, or NYPL&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/nypl.freegalmusic.com\/homes\/index\" target=\"_blank\">Freegal<\/a> (three DRM-free songs a week with your library card!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. &nbsp;Know Your Domains<\/strong><br>\r\n\tThere are different types of websites, but not all of them contain trustworthy information. If you are looking up something for school, stick to&nbsp;websites with these domains:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;.org = official organizations<br>\r\n\t.edu = educational (universities, research centers)<br>\r\n\t.gov = government<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other sites that end in .com or .net will often be commercial sites or personal webpages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Keep Track of Your Passwords<\/strong><br>\r\n\tBetween email accounts, library card PINS, and game or website usernames, it can get tough to keep track of all your passwords. It is usually a good idea to write them down whenever you create a new account and add it to a master list. If is up to you whether you use a notebook or a password site like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.passpack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Passpack<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http:\/\/keepass.info\/\" target=\"_blank\">KeePass<\/a>, but it is helpful to have all the information in a safe place.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. WiFi = Good, &nbsp; Data = Bad<\/strong><br>\r\n\tMany places, including restaurants and stores have free WiFi that you can connect to (including NYPL.) WiFi helps to transmit information so you are not using up the available data in your phone plan and can save you money and battery life. If you are having trouble connecting to WiFi where you are, ask someone who works there if there is WiFi available and what the password is. If you are enrolled in any <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nypl.org\/ost\" target=\"_blank\">Out-of-School Time<\/a> programs and you have no Internet at home it is possible to borrow a hotspot though NYPL&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/hotspot.nypl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Hotspot Program<\/a>.

I had the great fortune of sifting through box after box of Barvin&#39;s photo files and cherry-picking some of my favorites, over 200 of which are now available online at NYPL&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/collections\/bill-barvin-location-photograph-archive#\/?tab=about\">Digital Collections <\/a>website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-center\">\r\n\t<figure class=\"caption digcol-image\"><a data-url=\"3d247100-71b9-0132-3e8f-58d385a7bbd0\" href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/3d247100-71b9-0132-3e8f-58d385a7bbd0\"><img alt=\"Exterior street view, the Puck Building.

They were the same kind of inexpensive drugstore prints that my local pharmacy used to develop, the Kodak and Konica logos reproduced on the backs. Sometimes the photos were glued directly into the manila folders in which they were organized, folded over and creased if they were too long. Most interesting to me was the fact that Barvin often glued or taped multiple photos together to create a single, wider view of a particular location site. In such cases the side-by-side alignment of the photos was always just a little bit off, with color and tone changing from one photo to the next, the perspective skewed, the edges jagged and uneven. Facades of buildings were fractured and disjointed, sidewalk curbs didn&#39;t line up correctly, the tracks of elevated subway platforms were broken.

They were the same kind of inexpensive drugstore prints that my local pharmacy used to develop, the Kodak and Konica logos reproduced on the backs. Sometimes the photos were glued directly into the manila folders in which they were organized, folded over and creased if they were too long. Most interesting to me was the fact that Barvin often glued or taped multiple photos together to create a single, wider view of a particular location site. In such cases the side-by-side alignment of the photos was always just a little bit off, with color and tone changing from one photo to the next, the perspective skewed, the edges jagged and uneven. Facades of buildings were fractured and disjointed, sidewalk curbs didn't line up correctly, the tracks of elevated subway platforms were broken. Sometimes a person or object would be abruptly cut off mid-picture, or, alternately, would appear multiple times within a single image. On one Paterson, New Jersey street, for instance, half of a car moves down the road, while, simultaneously, the same bicycle appears three different times, once as a ghostly free-floating half wheel right in the center of the frame.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"digcol-image align-center align-center\">\n\t<figure class=\"caption caption caption digcol-image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/85f4b4a0-71ba-0132-a59e-58d385a7bbd0\"><img alt=\"Store interior, Main Street, Paterson, N.J.\" src=\"http:\/\/images.nypl.org\/index.php?id=5210075&amp;t=w\" width=\"500\" \/><\/a>\n\n\t\t<figcaption class=\"digcol-caption\">Store interior, Main Street, Paterson, N.J.
